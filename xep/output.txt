XEP-0016	a									[[Image:http://xmpp.org/images/xmpp.png]]	This specification defines an XMPP protocol extension for enabling or disabling communication with other entities on a network. The protocol, which was first standardized in Section 10 of RFC 3921, can be used to block communication with unknown or undesirable entities. Blocking can be based on Jabber Identifier, subscription state, or roster group. The blocked stanzas can be messages, IQs, inbound or outbound presence stanzas, or all stanzas. The protocol also enables an entity to create, modify, or delete its privacy lists, apply different lists to different connected resources, define a default list, and decline the use of any privacy list during a particular communications session.	http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0016.html

XEP-0030	a									[[Image:http://xmpp.org/images/xmpp.png]]	This specification defines an XMPP protocol extension for discovering information about other XMPP entities. Two kinds of information can be discovered: (1) the identity and capabilities of an entity, including the protocols and features it supports; and (2) the items associated with an entity, such as the list of rooms hosted at a multi-user chat service.	http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0030.html
XEP-0031	a									[[Image:http://xmpp.org/images/xmpp.png]]	 Although the value and utility of contemporary instant messaging  systems, like Jabber, are now indisputable, current security  features to protect message data are generally inadequate for  many deployments; this is particularly true in security conscious  environments like large, commercial enterprises and government  agencies. These current features suffer from issues of  scalability, usability, and supported features. Furthermore, there is a  lack of standardization.  We present a protocol to allow communities of Jabber users to  apply cryptographic protection to selected conversation data. 	http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0031.html

XEP-0059	a									[[Image:http://xmpp.org/images/xmpp.png]]	This specification defines an XMPP protocol extension that enables an entity to page through and otherwise manage the receipt of large result sets. The protocol can be used in the context of any XMPP protocol that might send large result sets (such as service discovery, multi-user chat, and publish-subscribe). While the requesting entity in such an interaction can explicitly request the use of result set management, an indication that result set management is in use can also be proactively included by the responding entity when returning a limited result set in response to a query.	http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0059.html
XEP-0060	a									[[Image:http://xmpp.org/images/xmpp.png]]	This specification defines an XMPP protocol extension for generic publish-subscribe functionality. The protocol enables XMPP entities to create nodes (topics) at a pubsub service and publish information at those nodes; an event notification (with or without payload) is then broadcasted to all entities that have subscribed to the node. Pubsub therefore adheres to the classic Observer design pattern and can serve as the foundation for a wide variety of applications, including news feeds, content syndication, rich presence, geolocation, workflow systems, network management systems, and any other application that requires event notifications.	http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0060.html

XEP-0071	a									[[Image:http://xmpp.org/images/xmpp.png]]	This specification defines an XHTML 1.0 Integration Set for use in exchanging instant messages that contain lightweight text markup. The protocol enables an XMPP entity to format a message using a small range of commonly-used HTML elements, attributes, and style properties that are suitable for use in instant messaging. The protocol also excludes HTML constructs that may introduce malware and other vulnerabilities (such as scripts and objects) for improved security.	http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0071.html
XEP-0072	a									[[Image:http://xmpp.org/images/xmpp.png]]	This specification defines methods for transporting SOAP messages over XMPP.
