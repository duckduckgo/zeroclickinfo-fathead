XEP-0004	A									[[Image:http://xmpp.org/images/xmpp.png]]	This specification defines an XMPP protocol extension for data forms that can be used in workflows such as service configuration as well as for application-specific data description and reporting. The protocol includes lightweight semantics for forms processing (such as request, response, submit, and cancel), defines several common field types (boolean, list options with single or multiple choice, text with single line or multiple lines, single or multiple JabberIDs, hidden fields, etc.), provides extensibility for future data types, and can be embedded in a wide range of applications. The protocol is not intended to provide complete forms-processing functionality as is provided in the W3C XForms technology, but instead provides a basic subset of such functionality for use by XMPP entities.	http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0004.html

XEP-0016	A									[[Image:http://xmpp.org/images/xmpp.png]]	This specification defines an XMPP protocol extension for enabling or disabling communication with other entities on a network. The protocol, which was first standardized in Section 10 of RFC 3921, can be used to block communication with unknown or undesirable entities. Blocking can be based on Jabber Identifier, subscription state, or roster group. The blocked stanzas can be messages, IQs, inbound or outbound presence stanzas, or all stanzas. The protocol also enables an entity to create, modify, or delete its privacy lists, apply different lists to different connected resources, define a default list, and decline the use of any privacy list during a particular communications session.	http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0016.html

The protocol can be used in the context of any XMPP protocol that might send large result sets (such as service discovery, multi-user chat, and publish-subscribe). While the requesting entity in such an interaction can explicitly request the use of result set management, an indication that result set management is in use can also be proactively included by the responding entity when returning a limited result set in response to a query.	http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0059.html

XEP-0060	A									[[Image:http://xmpp.org/images/xmpp.png]]	This specification defines an XMPP protocol extension for generic publish-subscribe functionality. The protocol enables XMPP entities to create nodes (topics) at a pubsub service and publish information at those nodes; an event notification (with or without payload) is then broadcasted to all entities that have subscribed to the node. Pubsub therefore adheres to the classic Observer design pattern and can serve as the foundation for a wide variety of applications, including news feeds, content syndication, rich presence, geolocation, workflow systems, network management systems, and any other application that requires event notifications.	http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0060.html

The bytestream can be either direct (peer-to-peer) or mediated (though a special-purpose proxy server). The typical transport protocol used is TCP, although UDP can optionally be supported as well.	http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0065.html

The protocol enables an XMPP entity to format a message using a small range of commonly-used HTML elements, attributes, and style properties that are suitable for use in instant messaging. The protocol also excludes HTML constructs that may introduce malware and other vulnerabilities (such as scripts and objects) for improved security.	http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0071.html

Although Server Dialback does not provide strong authentication or trusted federation and although it is subject to DNS poisoning attacks, it has effectively prevented most instances of address spoofing on the XMPP network since its development in the year 2000.	http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0220.html
