Examples across industries -- from music to cars -- show how close we are to this meshy future.	
Madeleine Albright: On being a woman and a diplomat	A			TEDWomen		[Madeleine  Albright]		[http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/1078 Official site]\n[http://www.ted.com/speakers/madeleine__albright.html TED Profile]\n		[[Image:http://www.ted.com/images/ted_amp_network.gif]]	Former US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright talks bluntly about politics and diplomacy, making the case that women's issues deserve a place at the center of foreign policy. Far from being a "soft" issue, she says, women's issues are often the very hardest ones, dealing directly with life and death. A frank and funny Q&A with Pat Mitchell from the Paley Center.

But, says economist Noreena Hertz, relying too much on experts can be limiting and even dangerous. She calls for us to start democratizing expertise -- to listen not only to "surgeons and CEOs, but also to shop staff."	
Iain Hutchison: Saving faces	A			TEDGlobal 2010		[Iain Hutchison]		[http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/1080 Official site]\n[http://www.ted.com/speakers/iain_hutchison.html TED Profile]\n		[[Image:http://images.ted.com/images/ted/f87490fd9c64f51f604d45fd172b86944fd63df8_254x191.jpg]]	Facial surgeon Iain Hutchison works with people whose faces have been severely disfigured. By pushing to improve surgical techniques, he helps to improve their lives; and by commissioning their portraits, he celebrates their humanity. NOTE: This talk contains images of disfigured and badly injured faces that may be disturbing -- and Hutchison provides thoughtful answers as to why a disfigured face can shock us so deeply. Squeamish? Hide your screen from 12:10 - 13:19, but do keep listening. Portraits shown in this talk come from Mark Gilbert.

As Hillis explains it, genomics shows us a list of the ingredients of the body -- while proteomics shows us what those ingredients produce. Understanding what's going on in your body at the protein level may lead to a new understanding of how cancer happens.

In a breakthrough experiment, Aaron O'Connell has blurred that distinction by creating an object that is visible to the unaided eye, but provably in two places at the same time. In this talk he suggests an intriguing way of thinking about the result.

He's found fossils with extraordinarily well-preserved blood vessels and soft tissues, but never intact DNA. So, in a new approach, he's taking living descendants of the dinosaur (chickens) and genetically engineering them to reactivate ancestral traits — including teeth, tails, and even hands — to make a "Chickenosaurus".
