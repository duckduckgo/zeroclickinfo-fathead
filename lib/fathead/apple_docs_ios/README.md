Introduction:
-------------
This is used to open an SQLite database that's installed on your computer to create a Fathead output
that's specified in http://docs.duckduckhack.com/resources/fathead-overview.html

See: https://forum.duckduckhack.com/t/improve-apple-os-x-macos-documentation/240

Page Structure:
---------------
There is no page structure here because we're essentially scraping a database. The only requirement is that you have XCode.

Pipeline:
---------
Read DB -> Scrape / Process -> Output

How do I test this?
-----
You'll need to have XCode installed on your computer. It comes bundled with the documentation that we need.
