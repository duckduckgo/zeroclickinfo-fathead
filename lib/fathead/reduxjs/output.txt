applyMiddleware	A										<section class="prog__container"><pre><code>applyMiddleware(...middlewares)</code></pre><p>Middleware is the suggested way to extend Redux with custom functionality. Middleware lets you wrap the store&apos;s <code>dispatch</code> method for fun and profit. The key feature of middleware is that it is composable. Multiple middleware can be combined together, where each middleware requires no knowledge of what comes before or after it in the chain.</p><p>The most common use case for middleware is to support asynchronous actions without much boilerplate code or a dependency on a library like Rx. It does so by letting you dispatch async actions in addition to normal actions.</p><p>For example, redux-thunk lets the action creators invert control by dispatching functions. They would receive <code>dispatch</code> as an argument and may call it asynchronously. Such functions are called <em>thunks</em>. Another example of middleware is redux-promise. It lets you dispatch a Promise async action, and dispatches a normal action when the Promise resolves.</p><p>Middleware is not baked into <code>createStore</code> and is not a fundamental part of the Redux architecture, but we consider it useful enough to be supported right in the core. This way, there is a single standard way to extend <code>dispatch</code> in the ecosystem, and different middleware may compete in expressiveness and utility.</p><span class="prog__sub">Arguments</span><span class="prog__ul"><li><code>...middlewares</code> (<em>arguments</em>): Functions that conform to the Redux <em>middleware API</em>. Each middleware receives <code>Store</code>&apos;s <code>dispatch</code> and <code>getState</code> functions as named arguments, and returns a function. That function will be given the <code>next</code> middleware&apos;s dispatch method, and is expected to return a function of <code>action</code> calling <code>next(action)</code> with a potentially different argument, or at a different time, or maybe not calling it at all. The last middleware in the chain will receive the real store&apos;s <code>dispatch</code> method as the <code>next</code> parameter, thus ending the chain. So, the middleware signature is <code>({ getState, dispatch }) =&gt; next =&gt; action</code>.</li></span><span class="prog__sub">Returns</span><p>(<em>Function</em>) A store enhancer that applies the given middleware. The store enhancer signature is <code>createStore =&gt; createStore&apos;</code> but the easiest way to apply it is to pass it to <code>createStore()</code> as the last <code>enhancer</code> argument.</p><span class="prog__sub">Example: Custom Logger Middleware</span><pre><code>import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux'\nimport todos from './reducers'\n\nfunction logger({ getState }) {\n  return (next) => (action) => {\n    console.log('will dispatch', action)\n\n    // Call the next dispatch method in the middleware chain.\n    let returnValue = next(action)\n\n    console.log('state after dispatch', getState())\n\n    // This will likely be the action itself, unless\n    // a middleware further in chain changed it.\n    return returnValue\n  }\n}\n\nlet store = createStore(\n  todos,\n  [ 'Use Redux' ],\n  applyMiddleware(logger)\n)\n\nstore.dispatch({\n  type: 'ADD_TODO',\n  text: 'Understand the middleware'\n})\n// (These lines will be logged by the

combineReducers	A										<section class="prog__container"><pre><code>combineReducers(reducers)</code></pre><p>As your app grows more complex, you&apos;ll want to split your reducing function into separate functions, each managing independent parts of the state.</p><p>The <code>combineReducers</code> helper function turns an object whose values are different reducing functions into a single reducing function you can pass to <code>createStore</code>.</p><p>The resulting reducer calls every child reducer, and gathers their results into a single state object. <strong>The shape of the state object matches the keys of the passed <code>reducers</code></strong>.</p><p>Consequently, the state object will look like this: </p><pre><code>{\n  reducer1: ...\n  reducer2: ...\n}\n</code></pre><p>You can control state key names by using different keys for the reducers in the passed object. For example, you may call <code>combineReducers({ todos: myTodosReducer, counter: myCounterReducer })</code> for the state shape to be <code>{ todos, counter }</code>.</p><p>A popular convention is to name reducers after the state slices they manage, so you can use ES6 property shorthand notation: <code>combineReducers({ counter, todos })</code>. This is equivalent to writing <code>combineReducers({ counter: counter, todos: todos })</code>.</p><blockquote></blockquote><span class="prog__sub">Arguments</span><ol><li><code>reducers</code> (<em>Object</em>): An object whose values correspond to different reducing functions that need to be combined into one.

This is why it attempts to enforce some rules that you don&apos;t have to follow if you write the root reducer manually.</p><p>Any reducer passed to <code>combineReducers</code> must satisfy these rules:</p><span class="prog__ul"><li><p>For any action that is not recognized, it must return the <code>state</code> given to it as the first argument.</p>\n</li><li><p>It must never return <code>undefined</code>. It is too easy to do this by mistake via an early <code>return</code> statement, so <code>combineReducers</code> throws if you do that instead of letting the error manifest itself somewhere else.</p>\n</li><li><p>If the <code>state</code> given to it is <code>undefined</code>, it must return the initial state for this specific reducer. According to the previous rule, the initial state must not be <code>undefined</code> either. It is handy to specify it with ES6 optional arguments syntax, but you can also explicitly check the first argument for being <code>undefined</code>.</p>\n</li></span><p>While <code>combineReducers</code> attempts to check that your reducers conform to some of these rules, you should remember them, and do your best to follow them. <code>combineReducers</code> will check your reducers by passing <code>undefined</code> to them; this is done even if you specify initial state to <code>Redux.createStore(combineReducers(...), initialState)</code>.
