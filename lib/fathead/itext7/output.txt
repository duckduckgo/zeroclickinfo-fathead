For this reason you will\n often encounter such parameter names as "outDoc" and "cmpDoc" which stand for output\n document and document-for-comparison. The first one is viewed as the current result,\n and the second one is referred as normal or ideal result. OutDoc is compared to the\n ideal cmpDoc. Therefore all reports of the comparison are in the form: "Expected ...,\n but was ...". This should be interpreted in the following way: "expected" part stands\n for the content of the cmpDoc and "but was" part stands for the content of the outDoc.</p></section>	http://itextsupport.com/apidocs/itext7/7.0.1/CompareTool.html

TernaryTree	A										<section class="prog__container"><p>Ternary Search Tree.\nA ternary search tree is a hibrid between a binary tree and\n a digital search tree (trie). Keys are limited to strings.\n A data value of type char is stored in each leaf node.\n It can be used as an index (or pointer) to the data.\n Branches that only contain one key are compressed to one node\n by storing a pointer to the trailer substring of the key.\n This class is intended to serve as base class or helper class\n to implement Dictionary collections or the like. Ternary trees\n have some nice properties as the following: the tree can be\n traversed in sorted order, partial matches (wildcard) can be\n implemented, retrieval of all keys within a given distance\n from the target, etc. The storage requirements are higher than\n a binary tree but a lot less than a trie. Performance is\n comparable with a hash table, sometimes it outperforms a hash\n function (most of the time can determine a miss faster than a hash).\nThe main purpose of this java port is to serve as a base for\n implementing TeX's hyphenation algorithm (see The TeXBook,\n appendix H). Each language requires from 5000 to 15000 hyphenation\n patterns which will be keys in this tree. The strings patterns\n are usually small (from 2 to 5 characters), but each char in the\n tree is stored in a node. Thus memory usage is the main concern.\n We will sacrify 'elegance' to keep memory requirements to the\n minimum. Using java's char type as pointer (yes, I know pointer\n it is a forbidden word in java) we can keep the size of the node\n to be just 8 bytes (3 pointers and the data char). This gives\n room for about 65000 nodes. In my tests the english patterns\n took 7694 nodes and the german patterns 10055 nodes,\n so I think we are safe.\nAll said, this is a map with strings as keys and char as value.\n Pretty limited!. It can be extended to a general map by\n using the string representation of an object and using the\n char value as an index to an array that contains the object\n values.\nThis work was authored by Carlos Villegas (cav@uniscope.co.jp).</p></section>	http://itextsupport.com/apidocs/itext7/7.0.1/TernaryTree.html

XMPIterator	A										<section class="prog__container"><p>Interface for the XMPMeta iteration services.\n XMPIterator provides a uniform means to iterate over the\n schema and properties within an XMP object.\n \n The iteration over the schema and properties within an XMP object is very\n complex. It is helpful to have a thorough understanding of the XMP data tree.\n One way to learn this is to create some complex XMP and examine the output of\n XMPMeta#toString. This is also described in the XMP\n Specification, in the XMP Data Model chapter.\n \n The top of the XMP data tree is a single root node. This does not explicitly\n appear in the dump and is never visited by an iterator (that is, it is never\n returned from XMPIterator#next()). Beneath the root are\n schema nodes. These are just collectors for top level properties in the same\n namespace. They are created and destroyed implicitly. Beneath the schema\n nodes are the property nodes. The nodes below a property node depend on its\n type (simple, struct, or array) and whether it has qualifiers.\n \n An XMPIterator is created by XMPMeta#interator() constructor\n defines a starting point for the iteration and options that control how it\n proceeds. By default the iteration starts at the root and visits all nodes\n beneath it in a depth first manner. The root node is not visited, the first\n visited node is a schema node. You can provide a schema name or property path\n to select a different starting node. By default this visits the named root\n node first then all nodes beneath it in a depth first manner.\n \n The XMPIterator#next() method delivers the schema URI, path,\n and option flags for the node being visited. If the node is simple it also\n delivers the value. Qualifiers for this node are visited next. The fields of\n a struct or items of an array are visited after the qualifiers of the parent.\n \n The options to control the iteration are:\n \nJUST_CHILDREN - Visit just the immediate children of the root. Skip\n the root itself and all nodes below the immediate children. This omits the\n qualifiers of the immediate children, the qualifier nodes being below what\n they qualify, default is to visit the complete subtree.\n JUST_LEAFNODES - Visit just the leaf property nodes and their\n qualifiers.\n JUST_LEAFNAME - Return just the leaf component of the node names.\n The default is to return the full xmp path.\n OMIT_QUALIFIERS - Do not visit the qualifiers.\n INCLUDE_ALIASES - Adds known alias properties to the properties in the iteration.\n                Note: Not supported in Java XMPCore! \n \n\nnext() returns XMPPropertyInfo-objects and throws\n a NoSuchElementException if there are no more properties to\n return.</p></section>	http://itextsupport.com/apidocs/itext7/7.0.1/XMPIterator.html

XMPPathFactory	A										<section class="prog__container"><p>Utility services for the metadata object. It has only public static functions, you cannot create\n an object. These are all functions that layer cleanly on top of the kernel XMP toolkit.\n \n These functions provide support for composing path expressions to deeply nested properties. The\n functions XMPMeta such as getProperty(),\n getArrayItem() and getStructField() provide easy access to top\n level simple properties, items in top level arrays, and fields of top level structs. They do not\n provide convenient access to more complex things like fields several levels deep in a complex\n struct, or fields within an array of structs, or items of an array that is a field of a struct.\n These functions can also be used to compose paths to top level array items or struct fields so\n that you can use the binary accessors like getPropertyAsInteger().\n \n You can use these functions is to compose a complete path expression, or all but the last\n component. Suppose you have a property that is an array of integers within a struct. You can\n access one of the array items like this:\n \n\n\n      String path = XMPPathFactory.composeStructFieldPath (schemaNS, "Struct", fieldNS,\n          "Array");\n      String path += XMPPathFactory.composeArrayItemPath (schemaNS, "Array" index);\n      PropertyInteger result = xmpObj.getPropertyAsInteger(schemaNS, path);\n \n You could also use this code if you want the string form of the integer:\n \n\n      String path = XMPPathFactory.composeStructFieldPath (schemaNS, "Struct", fieldNS,\n          "Array");\n      PropertyText xmpObj.getArrayItem (schemaNS, path, index);\n \n\n\nNote: It might look confusing that the schemaNS is passed in all of the calls above.\n This is because the XMP toolkit keeps the top level "schema" namespace separate from\n the rest of the path expression.\n Note: These methods are much simpler than in the C++-API, they don't check the given\n path or array indices.</p></section>	http://itextsupport.com/apidocs/itext7/7.0.1/XMPPathFactory.html

XMPSchemaRegistry	A										<section class="prog__container"><p>The schema registry keeps track of all namespaces and aliases used in the XMP\n metadata. At initialisation time, the default namespaces and default aliases\n are automatically registered. Namespaces must be registered before\n used in namespace URI parameters or path expressions. Within the XMP Toolkit\n the registered namespace URIs and prefixes must be unique. Additional\n namespaces encountered when parsing RDF are automatically registered. The\n namespace URI should always end in an XML name separator such as '/' or '#'.\n This is because some forms of RDF shorthand catenate a namespace URI with an\n element name to form a new URI.\n \nAliases in XMP serve the same purpose as Windows file shortcuts,\n Macintosh file aliases, or UNIX file symbolic links. The aliases are simply\n multiple names for the same property. One distinction of XMP aliases is that\n they are ordered, there is an alias name pointing to an actual name. The\n primary significance of the actual name is that it is the preferred name for\n output, generally the most widely recognized name.\n \n The names that can be aliased in XMP are restricted. The alias must be a top\n level property name, not a field within a structure or an element within an\n array. The actual may be a top level property name, the first element within\n a top level array, or the default element in an alt-text array. This does not\n mean the alias can only be a simple property. It is OK to alias a top level\n structure or array to an identical top level structure or array, or to the\n first item of an array of structures.</p></section>	http://itextsupport.com/apidocs/itext7/7.0.1/XMPSchemaRegistry.html
