## Layout Draft

> **no-console**
>
> Disallow the use of `console`.
>
> In JavaScript that is designed to be executed in the browser, itâ€™s considered a best practice to avoid using methods on `console`. Such messages are considered to be for debugging purposes and therefore not suitable to ship to the client. In general, calls using `console` should be stripped before being pushed to production.
>
> ```js
> console.log("Made it here.");
> console.error("That shouldn't have happened.");
> ```
>
> &#x2714; Recommended: <b>yes</b> | <b>&#x2192;</b> Fixable: <b>no</b>
