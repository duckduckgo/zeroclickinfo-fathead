Advice	A										<section class="prog__container">Tag interface for Advice. Implementations can be any type of advice, such as Interceptors.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/aopalliance/aop/Advice.html
AspectException	A										<section class="prog__container">Superclass for all AOP infrastructure exceptions. Unchecked, as such exceptions are fatal and end user code shouldn't be forced to catch them.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/aopalliance/aop/AspectException.html
ConstructorInterceptor	A										<section class="prog__container">Intercepts the construction of a new object. The user should implement the construct(ConstructorInvocation) method to modify the original behavior. E.g. the following class implements a singleton interceptor (allows only one unique instance for the intercepted class):  class DebuggingInterceptor implements ConstructorInterceptor {   Object instance=null;   Object construct(ConstructorInvocation i) throws Throwable {     if(instance==null) {       return instance=i.proceed();     } else {       throw new Exception("singleton does not allow multiple instance");     }   } } </section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/aopalliance/intercept/ConstructorInterceptor.html
ConstructorInvocation	A										<section class="prog__container">Description of an invocation to a constuctor, given to an interceptor upon constructor-call. A constructor invocation is a joinpoint and can be intercepted by a constructor interceptor.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/aopalliance/intercept/ConstructorInvocation.html
Interceptor	A										<section class="prog__container">This interface represents a generic interceptor. A generic interceptor can intercept runtime events that occur within a base program. Those events are materialized by (reified in) joinpoints. Runtime joinpoints can be invocations, field access, exceptions...  This interface is not used directly. Use the sub-interfaces to intercept specific events. For instance, the following class implements some specific interceptors in order to implement a debugger:  class DebuggingInterceptor implements MethodInterceptor,      ConstructorInterceptor, FieldInterceptor {   Object invoke(MethodInvocation i) throws Throwable {     debug(i.getMethod(), i.getThis(), i.getArgs());     return i.proceed();   }   Object construct(ConstructorInvocation i) throws Throwable {     debug(i.getConstructor(), i.getThis(), i.getArgs());     return i.proceed();   }    Object get(FieldAccess fa) throws Throwable {     debug(fa.getField(), fa.getThis(), null);     return fa.proceed();   }   Object set(FieldAccess fa) throws Throwable {     debug(fa.getField(), fa.getThis(), fa.getValueToSet());     return fa.proceed();   }   void debug(AccessibleObject ao, Object this, Object value) {     ...   } } </section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/aopalliance/intercept/Interceptor.html
Invocation	A										<section class="prog__container">This interface represents an invocation in the program. An invocation is a joinpoint and can be intercepted by an interceptor.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/aopalliance/intercept/Invocation.html
Joinpoint	A										<section class="prog__container">This interface represents a generic runtime joinpoint (in the AOP terminology). A runtime joinpoint is an event that occurs on a static joinpoint (i.e. a location in a the program). For instance, an invocation is the runtime joinpoint on a method (static joinpoint). The static part of a given joinpoint can be generically retrieved using the getStaticPart() method. In the context of an interception framework, a runtime joinpoint is then the reification of an access to an accessible object (a method, a constructor, a field), i.e. the static part of the joinpoint. It is passed to the interceptors that are installed on the static joinpoint.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/aopalliance/intercept/Joinpoint.html
MethodInterceptor	A										<section class="prog__container">Intercepts calls on an interface on its way to the target. These are nested "on top" of the target. The user should implement the invoke(MethodInvocation) method to modify the original behavior. E.g. the following class implements a tracing interceptor (traces all the calls on the intercepted method(s)):  class TracingInterceptor implements MethodInterceptor {   Object invoke(MethodInvocation i) throws Throwable {     System.out.println("method "+i.getMethod()+" is called on "+                        i.getThis()+" with args "+i.getArguments());     Object ret=i.proceed();     System.out.println("method "+i.getMethod()+" returns "+ret);     return ret;   } } </section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/aopalliance/intercept/MethodInterceptor.html

A method invocation is a joinpoint and can be intercepted by a method interceptor.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/aopalliance/intercept/MethodInvocation.html
WebappClassLoader	A										<section class="prog__container">A mock of Tomcat's WebappClassLoader just for Spring's compilation purposes. Exposes both pre-7.0.63 as well as 7.0.63+ variants of findResourceInternal.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/apache/catalina/loader/WebappClassLoader.html
Advisor	A										<section class="prog__container">Base interface holding AOP advice (action to take at a joinpoint) and a filter determining the applicability of the advice (such as a pointcut). This interface is not for use by Spring users, but to allow for commonality in support for different types of advice.Spring AOP is based around around advice delivered via method interception, compliant with the AOP Alliance interception API. The Advisor interface allows support for different types of advice, such as before and after advice, which need not be implemented using interception.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/aop/Advisor.html
AfterAdvice	A										<section class="prog__container">Common marker interface for after advice, such as AfterReturningAdvice and ThrowsAdvice.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/aop/AfterAdvice.html
AfterReturningAdvice	A										<section class="prog__container">After returning advice is invoked only on normal method return, not if an exception is thrown. Such advice can see the return value, but cannot change it.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/aop/AfterReturningAdvice.html
AopInvocationException	A										<section class="prog__container">Exception that gets thrown when an AOP invocation failed because of misconfiguration or unexpected runtime issues.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/aop/AopInvocationException.html
BeforeAdvice	A										<section class="prog__container">Common marker interface for before advice, such as MethodBeforeAdvice. Spring supports only method before advice. Although this is unlikely to change, this API is designed to allow field advice in future if desired.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/aop/BeforeAdvice.html
ClassFilter	A										<section class="prog__container">Filter that restricts matching of a pointcut or introduction to a given set of target classes. Can be used as part of a Pointcut or for the entire targeting of an IntroductionAdvisor.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/aop/ClassFilter.html
DynamicIntroductionAdvice	A										<section class="prog__container">Subinterface of AOP Alliance Advice that allows additional interfaces to be implemented by an Advice, and available via a proxy using that interceptor. This is a fundamental AOP concept called introduction. Introductions are often mixins, enabling the building of composite objects that can achieve many of the goals of multiple inheritance in Java. Compared to {qlink IntroductionInfo}, this interface allows an advice to implement a range of interfaces that is not necessarily known in advance. Thus an IntroductionAdvisor can be used to specify which interfaces will be exposed in an advised object.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/aop/DynamicIntroductionAdvice.html
IntroductionAdvisor	A										<section class="prog__container">Superinterface for advisors that perform one or more AOP introductions. This interface cannot be implemented directly; subinterfaces must provide the advice type implementing the introduction. Introduction is the implementation of additional interfaces (not implemented by a target) via AOP advice.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/aop/IntroductionAdvisor.html
IntroductionAwareMethodMatcher	A										<section class="prog__container">A specialized type of MethodMatcher that takes into account introductions when matching methods. If there are no introductions on the target class, a method matcher may be able to optimize matching more effectively for example.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/aop/IntroductionAwareMethodMatcher.html
IntroductionInfo	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface supplying the information necessary to describe an introduction. IntroductionAdvisors must implement this interface. If an Advice implements this, it may be used as an introduction without an IntroductionAdvisor. In this case, the advice is self-describing, providing not only the necessary behavior, but describing the interfaces it introduces.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/aop/IntroductionInfo.html
IntroductionInterceptor	A										<section class="prog__container">Subinterface of AOP Alliance MethodInterceptor that allows additional interfaces to be implemented by the interceptor, and available via a proxy using that interceptor. This is a fundamental AOP concept called introduction. Introductions are often mixins, enabling the building of composite objects that can achieve many of the goals of multiple inheritance in Java.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/aop/IntroductionInterceptor.html
MethodBeforeAdvice	A										<section class="prog__container">Advice invoked before a method is invoked. Such advices cannot prevent the method call proceeding, unless they throw a Throwable.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/aop/MethodBeforeAdvice.html
MethodMatcher	A										<section class="prog__container">Part of a Pointcut: Checks whether the target method is eligible for advice. A MethodMatcher may be evaluated statically or at runtime (dynamically). Static matching involves method and (possibly) method attributes. Dynamic matching also makes arguments for a particular call available, and any effects of running previous advice applying to the joinpoint. If an implementation returns false from its isRuntime() method, evaluation can be performed statically, and the result will be the same for all invocations of this method, whatever their arguments. This means that if the isRuntime() method returns false, the 3-arg matches(java.lang.reflect.Method, Class, Object[]) method will never be invoked. If an implementation returns true from its 2-arg matches(java.lang.reflect.Method, Class) method and its isRuntime() method returns true, the 3-arg matches(java.lang.reflect.Method, Class, Object[]) method will be invoked immediately before each potential execution of the related advice, to decide whether the advice should run. All previous advice, such as earlier interceptors in an interceptor chain, will have run, so any state changes they have produced in parameters or ThreadLocal state will be available at the time of evaluation.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/aop/MethodMatcher.html
Pointcut	A										<section class="prog__container">Core Spring pointcut abstraction. A pointcut is composed of a ClassFilter and a MethodMatcher. Both these basic terms and a Pointcut itself can be combined to build up combinations (e.g. through ComposablePointcut).</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/aop/Pointcut.html
PointcutAdvisor	A										<section class="prog__container">Superinterface for all Advisors that are driven by a pointcut. This covers nearly all advisors except introduction advisors, for which method-level matching doesn't apply.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/aop/PointcutAdvisor.html
ProxyMethodInvocation	A										<section class="prog__container">Extension of the AOP Alliance MethodInvocation interface, allowing access to the proxy that the method invocation was made through. Useful to be able to substitute return values with the proxy, if necessary, for example if the invocation target returned itself.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/aop/ProxyMethodInvocation.html
RawTargetAccess	A										<section class="prog__container">Marker for AOP proxy interfaces (in particular: introduction interfaces) that explicitly intend to return the raw target object (which would normally get replaced with the proxy object when returned from a method invocation). Note that this is a marker interface in the style of Serializable, semantically applying to a declared interface rather than to the full class of a concrete object. In other words, this marker applies to a particular interface only (typically an introduction interface that does not serve as the primary interface of an AOP proxy), and hence does not affect other interfaces that a concrete AOP proxy may implement.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/aop/RawTargetAccess.html
SpringProxy	A										<section class="prog__container">Marker interface implemented by all AOP proxies. Used to detect whether or not objects are Spring-generated proxies.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/aop/SpringProxy.html
TargetClassAware	A										<section class="prog__container">Minimal interface for exposing the target class behind a proxy. Implemented by AOP proxy objects and proxy factories (via Advised) as well as by TargetSources.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/aop/TargetClassAware.html
TargetSource	A										<section class="prog__container">A TargetSource is used to obtain the current "target" of an AOP invocation, which will be invoked via reflection if no around advice chooses to end the interceptor chain itself. If a TargetSource is "static", it will always return the same target, allowing optimizations in the AOP framework. Dynamic target sources can support pooling, hot swapping, etc. Application developers don't usually need to work with TargetSources directly: this is an AOP framework interface.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/aop/TargetSource.html
ThrowsAdvice	A										<section class="prog__container">Tag interface for throws advice. There are not any methods on this interface, as methods are invoked by reflection. Implementing classes must implement methods of the form: void afterThrowing([Method, args, target], ThrowableSubclass);Some examples of valid methods would be: public void afterThrowing(Exception ex)public void afterThrowing(RemoteException)public void afterThrowing(Method method, Object[] args, Object target, Exception ex)public void afterThrowing(Method method, Object[] args, Object target, ServletException ex) The first three arguments are optional, and only useful if we want further information about the joinpoint, as in AspectJ after-throwing advice. Note: If a throws-advice method throws an exception itself, it will override the original exception (i.e. change the exception thrown to the user). The overriding exception will typically be a RuntimeException; this is compatible with any method signature. However, if a throws-advice method throws a checked exception, it will have to match the declared exceptions of the target method and is hence to some degree coupled to specific target method signatures. Do not throw an undeclared checked exception that is incompatible with the target method's signature!</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/aop/ThrowsAdvice.html
AbstractAspectJAdvice	A										<section class="prog__container">Base class for AOP Alliance Advice classes wrapping an AspectJ aspect or an AspectJ-annotated advice method.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/aop/aspectj/AbstractAspectJAdvice.html
AspectInstanceFactory	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface implemented to provide an instance of an AspectJ aspect. Decouples from Spring's bean factory. Extends the Ordered interface to express an order value for the underlying aspect in a chain.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/aop/aspectj/AspectInstanceFactory.html
AspectJAdviceParameterNameDiscoverer.AmbiguousBindingException	A										<section class="prog__container">Thrown in response to an ambiguous binding being detected when trying to resolve a method's parameter names.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/aop/aspectj/AspectJAdviceParameterNameDiscoverer.AmbiguousBindingException.html
AspectJAdviceParameterNameDiscoverer	A										<section class="prog__container">ParameterNameDiscoverer implementation that tries to deduce parameter names for an advice method from the pointcut expression, returning, and throwing clauses. If an unambiguous interpretation is not available, it returns null. This class interprets arguments in the following way: If the first parameter of the method is of type JoinPoint or ProceedingJoinPoint, it is assumed to be for passing thisJoinPoint to the advice, and the parameter name will be assigned the value "thisJoinPoint".If the first parameter of the method is of type JoinPoint.StaticPart, it is assumed to be for passing "thisJoinPointStaticPart" to the advice, and the parameter name will be assigned the value "thisJoinPointStaticPart".If a throwingName has been set, and there are no unbound arguments of type Throwable+, then an IllegalArgumentException is raised. If there is more than one unbound argument of type Throwable+, then an AspectJAdviceParameterNameDiscoverer.AmbiguousBindingException is raised. If there is exactly one unbound argument of type Throwable+, then the corresponding parameter name is assigned the value <throwingName>.If there remain unbound arguments, then the pointcut expression is examined. Let a be the number of annotation-based pointcut expressions (@annotation, @this, @target, @args, @within, @withincode) that are used in binding form. Usage in binding form has itself to be deduced: if the expression inside the pointcut is a single string literal that meets Java variable name conventions it is assumed to be a variable name. If a is zero we proceed to the next stage. If a > 1 then an AmbiguousBindingException is raised. If a == 1, and there are no unbound arguments of type Annotation+, then an IllegalArgumentException is raised. if there is exactly one such argument, then the corresponding parameter name is assigned the value from the pointcut expression.If a returningName has been set, and there are no unbound arguments then an IllegalArgumentException is raised. If there is more than one unbound argument then an AmbiguousBindingException is raised. If there is exactly one unbound argument then the corresponding parameter name is assigned the value <returningName>.If there remain unbound arguments, then the pointcut expression is examined once more for this, target, and args pointcut expressions used in the binding form (binding forms are deduced as described for the annotation based pointcuts). If there remains more than one unbound argument of a primitive type (which can only be bound in args) then an AmbiguousBindingException is raised. If there is exactly one argument of a primitive type, then if exactly one args bound variable was found, we assign the corresponding parameter name the variable name. If there were no args bound variables found an IllegalStateException is raised. If there are multiple args bound variables, an AmbiguousBindingException is raised. At this point, if there remains more than one unbound argument we raise an AmbiguousBindingException. If there are no unbound arguments remaining, we are done. If there is exactly one unbound argument remaining, and only one candidate variable name unbound from this, target, or args, it is assigned as the corresponding parameter name. If there are multiple possibilities, an AmbiguousBindingException is raised.The behavior on raising an IllegalArgumentException or AmbiguousBindingException is configurable to allow this discoverer to be used as part of a chain-of-responsibility. By default the condition will be logged and the getParameterNames(..) method will simply return null. If the raiseExceptions property is set to true, the conditions will be thrown as IllegalArgumentException and AmbiguousBindingException, respectively. Was that perfectly clear? ;) Short version: If an unambiguous binding can be deduced, then it is. If the advice requirements cannot possibly be satisfied, then null is returned. By setting the raiseExceptions property to true, descriptive exceptions will be thrown instead of returning null in the case that the parameter names cannot be discovered.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/aop/aspectj/AspectJAdviceParameterNameDiscoverer.html

AbstractInterceptorDrivenBeanDefinitionDecorator	A										<section class="prog__container">Base implementation for BeanDefinitionDecorators wishing to add an interceptor to the resulting bean. This base class controls the creation of the ProxyFactoryBean bean definition and wraps the original as an inner-bean definition for the target property of ProxyFactoryBean. Chaining is correctly handled, ensuring that only one ProxyFactoryBean definition is created. If a previous BeanDefinitionDecorator already created the ProxyFactoryBean then the interceptor is simply added to the existing definition.

The currentProxy() method is usable if the AOP framework is configured to expose the current proxy (not the default). It returns the AOP proxy in use. Target objects or advice can use this to make advised calls, in the same way as getEJBObject() can be used in EJBs. They can also use it to find advice configuration. Spring's AOP framework does not expose proxies by default, as there is a performance cost in doing so. The functionality in this class might be used by a target object that needed access to resources on the invocation. However, this approach should not be used when there is a reasonable alternative, as it makes application code dependent on usage under AOP and the Spring AOP framework in particular.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/aop/framework/AopContext.html

They should be thread-safe if advisors and target are thread-safe. Proxies may or may not allow advice changes to be made. If they do not permit advice changes (for example, because the configuration was frozen) a proxy should throw an AopConfigException on an attempted advice change.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/aop/framework/AopProxyFactory.html

ProxyFactoryBean	A										<section class="prog__container">FactoryBean implementation that builds an AOP proxy based on beans in Spring BeanFactory. MethodInterceptors and Advisors are identified by a list of bean names in the current bean factory, specified through the "interceptorNames" property. The last entry in the list can be the name of a target bean or a TargetSource; however, it is normally preferable to use the "targetName"/"target"/"targetSource" properties instead. Global interceptors and advisors can be added at the factory level. The specified ones are expanded in an interceptor list where an "xxx*" entry is included in the list, matching the given prefix with the bean names (e.g. "global*" would match both "globalBean1" and "globalBean2", "*" all defined interceptors). The matching interceptors get applied according to their returned order value, if they implement the Ordered interface. Creates a JDK proxy when proxy interfaces are given, and a CGLIB proxy for the actual target class if not. Note that the latter will only work if the target class does not have final methods, as a dynamic subclass will be created at runtime. It's possible to cast a proxy obtained from this factory to Advised, or to obtain the ProxyFactoryBean reference and programmatically manipulate it. This won't work for existing prototype references, which are independent. However, it will work for prototypes subsequently obtained from the factory. Changes to interception will work immediately on singletons (including existing references). However, to change interfaces or target it's necessary to obtain a new instance from the factory. This means that singleton instances obtained from the factory do not have the same object identity. However, they do have the same interceptors and target, and changing any reference will change all objects.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/aop/framework/ProxyFactoryBean.html

ReflectiveMethodInvocation	A										<section class="prog__container">Spring's implementation of the AOP Alliance MethodInvocation interface, implementing the extended ProxyMethodInvocation interface. Invokes the target object using reflection. Subclasses can override the invokeJoinpoint() method to change this behavior, so this is also a useful base class for more specialized MethodInvocation implementations. It is possible to clone an invocation, to invoke proceed() repeatedly (once per clone), using the invocableClone() method. It is also possible to attach custom attributes to the invocation, using the setUserAttribute(java.lang.String, java.lang.Object) / getUserAttribute(java.lang.String) methods. NOTE: This class is considered internal and should not be directly accessed. The sole reason for it being public is compatibility with existing framework integrations (e.g. Pitchfork). For any other purposes, use the ProxyMethodInvocation interface instead.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/aop/framework/ReflectiveMethodInvocation.html
AdvisorAdapter	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface allowing extension to the Spring AOP framework to allow handling of new Advisors and Advice types. Implementing objects can create AOP Alliance Interceptors from custom advice types, enabling these advice types to be used in the Spring AOP framework, which uses interception under the covers. There is no need for most Spring users to implement this interface; do so only if you need to introduce more Advisor or Advice types to Spring.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/aop/framework/adapter/AdvisorAdapter.html
AdvisorAdapterRegistrationManager	A										<section class="prog__container">BeanPostProcessor that registers AdvisorAdapter beans in the BeanFactory with an AdvisorAdapterRegistry (by default the GlobalAdvisorAdapterRegistry). The only requirement for it to work is that it needs to be defined in application context along with "non-native" Spring AdvisorAdapters that need to be "recognized" by Spring's AOP framework.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/aop/framework/adapter/AdvisorAdapterRegistrationManager.html

AbstractAdvisorAutoProxyCreator	A										<section class="prog__container">Generic auto proxy creator that builds AOP proxies for specific beans based on detected Advisors for each bean. Subclasses must implement the abstract findCandidateAdvisors() method to return a list of Advisors applying to any object. Subclasses can also override the inherited AbstractAutoProxyCreator.shouldSkip(java.lang.Class<?>, java.lang.String) method to exclude certain objects from auto-proxying. Advisors or advices requiring ordering should implement the Ordered interface. This class sorts Advisors by Ordered order value. Advisors that don't implement the Ordered interface will be considered as unordered; they will appear at the end of the advisor chain in undefined order.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/aop/framework/autoproxy/AbstractAdvisorAutoProxyCreator.html
AbstractAutoProxyCreator	A										<section class="prog__container">BeanPostProcessor implementation that wraps each eligible bean with an AOP proxy, delegating to specified interceptors before invoking the bean itself. This class distinguishes between "common" interceptors: shared for all proxies it creates, and "specific" interceptors: unique per bean instance. There need not be any common interceptors. If there are, they are set using the interceptorNames property. As with ProxyFactoryBean, interceptors names in the current factory are used rather than bean references to allow correct handling of prototype advisors and interceptors: for example, to support stateful mixins. Any advice type is supported for "interceptorNames" entries. Such auto-proxying is particularly useful if there's a large number of beans that need to be wrapped with similar proxies, i.e. delegating to the same interceptors. Instead of x repetitive proxy definitions for x target beans, you can register one single such post processor with the bean factory to achieve the same effect. Subclasses can apply any strategy to decide if a bean is to be proxied, e.g. by type, by name, by definition details, etc. They can also return additional interceptors that should just be applied to the specific bean instance. The default concrete implementation is BeanNameAutoProxyCreator, identifying the beans to be proxied via a list of bean names. Any number of TargetSourceCreator implementations can be used to create a custom target source - for example, to pool prototype objects. Auto-proxying will occur even if there is no advice, as long as a TargetSourceCreator specifies a custom TargetSource. If there are no TargetSourceCreators set, or if none matches, a SingletonTargetSource will be used by default to wrap the target bean instance.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/aop/framework/autoproxy/AbstractAutoProxyCreator.html
AbstractBeanFactoryAwareAdvisingPostProcessor	A										<section class="prog__container">Extension of AbstractAutoProxyCreator which implements BeanFactoryAware, adds exposure of the original target class for each proxied bean (AutoProxyUtils.ORIGINAL_TARGET_CLASS_ATTRIBUTE), and participates in an externally enforced target-class mode for any given bean (AutoProxyUtils.PRESERVE_TARGET_CLASS_ATTRIBUTE).

DefaultAdvisorAutoProxyCreator	A										<section class="prog__container">BeanPostProcessor implementation that creates AOP proxies based on all candidate Advisors in the current BeanFactory. This class is completely generic; it contains no special code to handle any particular aspects, such as pooling aspects. It's possible to filter out advisors - for example, to use multiple post processors of this type in the same factory - by setting the usePrefix property to true, in which case only advisors beginning with the DefaultAdvisorAutoProxyCreator's bean name followed by a dot (like "aapc.") will be used. This default prefix can be changed from the bean name by setting the advisorBeanNamePrefix property. The separator (.) will also be used in this case.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/aop/framework/autoproxy/DefaultAdvisorAutoProxyCreator.html
InfrastructureAdvisorAutoProxyCreator	A										<section class="prog__container">Auto-proxy creator that considers infrastructure Advisor beans only, ignoring any application-defined Advisors.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/aop/framework/autoproxy/InfrastructureAdvisorAutoProxyCreator.html

AbstractBeanFactoryBasedTargetSourceCreator	A										<section class="prog__container">Convenient superclass for TargetSourceCreator implementations that require creating multiple instances of a prototype bean. Uses an internal BeanFactory to manage the target instances, copying the original bean definition to this internal factory. This is necessary because the original BeanFactory will just contain the proxy instance created through auto-proxying. Requires running in an AbstractBeanFactory.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/aop/framework/autoproxy/target/AbstractBeanFactoryBasedTargetSourceCreator.html
LazyInitTargetSourceCreator	A										<section class="prog__container">TargetSourceCreator that enforces a LazyInitTargetSource for each bean that is defined as "lazy-init". This will lead to a proxy created for each of those beans, allowing to fetch a reference to such a bean without actually initializing the target bean instance. To be registered as custom TargetSourceCreator for an auto-proxy creator, in combination with custom interceptors for specific beans or for the creation of lazy-init proxies only. For example, as autodetected infrastructure bean in an XML application context definition:  <bean class="org.springframework.aop.framework.autoproxy.BeanNameAutoProxyCreator">   <property name="customTargetSourceCreators">     <list>       <bean class="org.springframework.aop.framework.autoproxy.target.LazyInitTargetSourceCreator"/>     </list>   </property> </bean> <bean id="myLazyInitBean" class="mypackage.MyBeanClass" lazy-init="true">   ... </bean></section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/aop/framework/autoproxy/target/LazyInitTargetSourceCreator.html

AbstractMonitoringInterceptor	A										<section class="prog__container">Base class for monitoring interceptors, such as performance monitors. Provides prefix and suffix properties that help to classify/group performance monitoring results. Subclasses should call the createInvocationTraceName(MethodInvocation) method to create a name for the given trace that includes information about the method invocation under trace along with the prefix and suffix added as appropriate.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/aop/interceptor/AbstractMonitoringInterceptor.html
AbstractTraceInterceptor	A										<section class="prog__container">Base MethodInterceptor implementation for tracing. By default, log messages are written to the log for the interceptor class, not the class which is being intercepted. Setting the useDynamicLogger bean property to true causes all log messages to be written to the Log for the target class being intercepted. Subclasses must implement the invokeUnderTrace method, which is invoked by this class ONLY when a particular invocation SHOULD be traced. Subclasses should write to the Log instance provided.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/aop/interceptor/AbstractTraceInterceptor.html
AsyncExecutionAspectSupport	A										<section class="prog__container">Base class for asynchronous method execution aspects, such as org.springframework.scheduling.annotation.AnnotationAsyncExecutionInterceptor or org.springframework.scheduling.aspectj.AnnotationAsyncExecutionAspect. Provides support for executor qualification on a method-by-method basis. AsyncExecutionAspectSupport objects must be constructed with a default Executor, but each individual method may further qualify a specific Executor bean to be used when executing it, e.g. through an annotation attribute.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/aop/interceptor/AsyncExecutionAspectSupport.html
AsyncExecutionInterceptor	A										<section class="prog__container">AOP Alliance MethodInterceptor that processes method invocations asynchronously, using a given AsyncTaskExecutor. Typically used with the Async annotation. In terms of target method signatures, any parameter types are supported. However, the return type is constrained to either void or java.util.concurrent.Future. In the latter case, the Future handle returned from the proxy will be an actual asynchronous Future that can be used to track the result of the asynchronous method execution. However, since the target method needs to implement the same signature, it will have to return a temporary Future handle that just passes the return value through (like Spring's AsyncResult or EJB 3.1's javax.ejb.AsyncResult). When the return type is java.util.concurrent.Future, any exception thrown during the execution can be accessed and managed by the caller. With void return type however, such exceptions cannot be transmitted back. In that case an AsyncUncaughtExceptionHandler can be registered to process such exceptions. As of Spring 3.1.2 the AnnotationAsyncExecutionInterceptor subclass is preferred for use due to its support for executor qualification in conjunction with Spring's @Async annotation.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/aop/interceptor/AsyncExecutionInterceptor.html
AsyncUncaughtExceptionHandler	A										<section class="prog__container">A strategy for handling uncaught exceptions thrown from asynchronous methods. An asynchronous method usually returns a Future instance that gives access to the underlying exception. When the method does not provide that return type, this handler can be used to managed such uncaught exceptions.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/aop/interceptor/AsyncUncaughtExceptionHandler.html
ConcurrencyThrottleInterceptor	A										<section class="prog__container">Interceptor that throttles concurrent access, blocking invocations if a specified concurrency limit is reached. Can be applied to methods of local services that involve heavy use of system resources, in a scenario where it is more efficient to throttle concurrency for a specific service rather than restricting the entire thread pool (e.g. the web container's thread pool). The default concurrency limit of this interceptor is 1. Specify the "concurrencyLimit" bean property to change this value.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/aop/interceptor/ConcurrencyThrottleInterceptor.html
CustomizableTraceInterceptor	A										<section class="prog__container">MethodInterceptor implementation that allows for highly customizable method-level tracing, using placeholders. Trace messages are written on method entry, and if the method invocation succeeds on method exit. If an invocation results in an exception, then an exception message is written. The contents of these trace messages is fully customizable and special placeholders are available to allow you to include runtime information in your log messages. The placeholders available are: $[methodName] - replaced with the name of the method being invoked$[targetClassName] - replaced with the name of the class that is the target of the invocation$[targetClassShortName] - replaced with the short name of the class that is the target of the invocation$[returnValue] - replaced with the value returned by the invocation$[argumentTypes] - replaced with a comma-separated list of the short class names of the method arguments$[arguments] - replaced with a comma-separated list of the String representation of the method arguments$[exception] - replaced with the String representation of any Throwable raised during the invocation$[invocationTime] - replaced with the time, in milliseconds, taken by the method invocationThere are restrictions on which placeholders can be used in which messages: see the individual message properties for details on the valid placeholders.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/aop/interceptor/CustomizableTraceInterceptor.html
DebugInterceptor	A										<section class="prog__container">AOP Alliance MethodInterceptor that can be introduced in a chain to display verbose information about intercepted invocations to the logger.

ExposeInvocationInterceptor	A										<section class="prog__container">Interceptor that exposes the current MethodInvocation as a thread-local object. We occasionally need to do this; for example, when a pointcut (e.g. an AspectJ expression pointcut) needs to know the full invocation context. Don't use this interceptor unless this is really necessary. Target objects should not normally know about Spring AOP, as this creates a dependency on Spring API. Target objects should be plain POJOs as far as possible. If used, this interceptor will normally be the first in the interceptor chain.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/aop/interceptor/ExposeInvocationInterceptor.html
JamonPerformanceMonitorInterceptor	A										<section class="prog__container">Performance monitor interceptor that uses JAMon library to perform the performance measurement on the intercepted method and output the stats.

ScopedProxyFactoryBean	A										<section class="prog__container">Convenient proxy factory bean for scoped objects. Proxies created using this factory bean are thread-safe singletons and may be injected into shared objects, with transparent scoping behavior. Proxies returned by this class implement the ScopedObject interface. This presently allows for removing the corresponding object from the scope, seamlessly creating a new instance in the scope on next access. Please note that the proxies created by this factory are class-based proxies by default. This can be customized through switching the "proxyTargetClass" property to "false".</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/aop/scope/ScopedProxyFactoryBean.html

AbstractRegexpMethodPointcut	A										<section class="prog__container">Abstract base regular expression pointcut bean. JavaBean properties are: pattern: regular expression for the fully-qualified method names to match. The exact regexp syntax will depend on the subclass (e.g. Perl5 regular expressions) patterns: alternative property taking a String array of patterns. The result will be the union of these patterns. Note: the regular expressions must be a match. For example, .*get.* will match com.mycom.Foo.getBar(). get.* will not. This base class is serializable. Subclasses should declare all fields transient; the initPatternRepresentation(java.lang.String[]) method will be invoked again on deserialization.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/aop/support/AbstractRegexpMethodPointcut.html

DelegatePerTargetObjectIntroductionInterceptor	A										<section class="prog__container">Convenient implementation of the IntroductionInterceptor interface. This differs from DelegatingIntroductionInterceptor in that a single instance of this class can be used to advise multiple target objects, and each target object will have its own delegate (whereas DelegatingIntroductionInterceptor shares the same delegate, and hence the same state across all targets). The suppressInterface method can be used to suppress interfaces implemented by the delegate class but which should not be introduced to the owning AOP proxy. An instance of this class is serializable if the delegates are. Note: There are some implementation similarities between this class and DelegatingIntroductionInterceptor that suggest a possible refactoring to extract a common ancestor class in the future.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/aop/support/DelegatePerTargetObjectIntroductionInterceptor.html
DelegatingIntroductionInterceptor	A										<section class="prog__container">Convenient implementation of the IntroductionInterceptor interface.

Alternatively a separate delegate may implement the interface, and be set via the delegate bean property. Delegates or subclasses may implement any number of interfaces. All interfaces except IntroductionInterceptor are picked up from the subclass or delegate by default. The suppressInterface method can be used to suppress interfaces implemented by the delegate but which should not be introduced to the owning AOP proxy.

AbstractBeanFactoryBasedTargetSource	A										<section class="prog__container">Base class for TargetSource implementations that are based on a Spring BeanFactory, delegating to Spring-managed bean instances. Subclasses can create prototype instances or lazily access a singleton target, for example. See LazyInitTargetSource and AbstractPrototypeBasedTargetSource's subclasses for concrete strategies.

This involves disconnecting the current target and turning into a SingletonTargetSource.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/aop/target/AbstractBeanFactoryBasedTargetSource.html
AbstractLazyCreationTargetSource	A										<section class="prog__container">TargetSource implementation that will lazily create a user-managed object. Creation of the lazy target object is controlled by the user by implementing the createObject() method. This TargetSource will invoke this method the first time the proxy is accessed. Useful when you need to pass a reference to some dependency to an object but you don't actually want the dependency to be created until it is first used. A typical scenario for this is a connection to a remote resource.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/aop/target/AbstractLazyCreationTargetSource.html
AbstractPoolingTargetSource	A										<section class="prog__container">Abstract base class for pooling TargetSource implementations which maintain a pool of target instances, acquiring and releasing a target object from the pool for each method invocation. This abstract base class is independent of concrete pooling technology; see the subclass CommonsPool2TargetSource for a concrete example. Subclasses must implement the getTarget() and releaseTarget(java.lang.Object) methods based on their chosen object pool. The AbstractPrototypeBasedTargetSource.newPrototypeInstance() method inherited from AbstractPrototypeBasedTargetSource can be used to create objects in order to put them into the pool. Subclasses must also implement some of the monitoring methods from the PoolingConfig interface. The getPoolingConfigMixin() method makes these stats available on proxied objects through an IntroductionAdvisor. This class implements the DisposableBean interface in order to force subclasses to implement a DisposableBean.destroy() method, closing down their object pool.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/aop/target/AbstractPoolingTargetSource.html
AbstractPrototypeBasedTargetSource	A										<section class="prog__container">Base class for dynamic TargetSource implementations that create new prototype bean instances to support a pooling or new-instance-per-invocation strategy. Such TargetSources must run in a BeanFactory, as it needs to call the getBean method to create a new prototype instance. Therefore, this base class extends AbstractBeanFactoryBasedTargetSource.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/aop/target/AbstractPrototypeBasedTargetSource.html
CommonsPool2TargetSource	A										<section class="prog__container">TargetSource implementation that holds objects in a configurable Apache Commons2 Pool. By default, an instance of GenericObjectPool is created. Subclasses may change the type of ObjectPool used by overriding the createObjectPool() method. Provides many configuration properties mirroring those of the Commons Pool GenericObjectPool class; these properties are passed to the GenericObjectPool during construction. If creating a subclass of this class to change the ObjectPool implementation type, pass in the values of configuration properties that are relevant to your chosen implementation. The testOnBorrow, testOnReturn and testWhileIdle properties are explicitly not mirrored because the implementation of PoolableObjectFactory used by this class does not implement meaningful validation. All exposed Commons Pool properties use the corresponding Commons Pool defaults. Compatible with Apache Commons Pool 2.4, as of Spring 4.2.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/aop/target/CommonsPool2TargetSource.html
CommonsPoolTargetSource	A										<section class="prog__container">Deprecated. as of Spring 4.2, in favor of CommonsPool2TargetSource</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/aop/target/CommonsPoolTargetSource.html

HotSwappableTargetSource	A										<section class="prog__container">TargetSource implementation that caches a local target object, but allows the target to be swapped while the application is running. If configuring an object of this class in a Spring IoC container, use constructor injection. This TargetSource is serializable if the target is at the time of serialization.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/aop/target/HotSwappableTargetSource.html
LazyInitTargetSource	A										<section class="prog__container">TargetSource that lazily accesses a singleton bean from a BeanFactory. Useful when a proxy reference is needed on initialization but the actual target object should not be initialized until first use. When the target bean is defined in an ApplicationContext (or a BeanFactory that is eagerly pre-instantiating singleton beans) it must be marked as "lazy-init" too, else it will be instantiated by said ApplicationContext (or BeanFactory) on startup. For example:  <bean id="serviceTarget" class="example.MyService" lazy-init="true">   ... </bean> <bean id="service" class="org.springframework.aop.framework.ProxyFactoryBean">   <property name="targetSource">     <bean class="org.springframework.aop.target.LazyInitTargetSource">       <property name="targetBeanName"><idref local="serviceTarget"/></property>     </bean>   </property> </bean> The "serviceTarget" bean will not get initialized until a method on the "service" proxy gets invoked. Subclasses can extend this class and override the postProcessTargetObject(Object) to perform some additional processing with the target object when it is first loaded.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/aop/target/LazyInitTargetSource.html

SingletonTargetSource	A										<section class="prog__container">Implementation of the TargetSource interface that holds a given object. This is the default implementation of the TargetSource interface, as used by the Spring AOP framework. There is usually no need to create objects of this class in application code. This class is serializable. However, the actual serializability of a SingletonTargetSource will depend on whether the target is serializable.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/aop/target/SingletonTargetSource.html
ThreadLocalTargetSource	A										<section class="prog__container">Alternative to an object pool. This TargetSource uses a threading model in which every thread has its own copy of the target. There's no contention for targets. Target object creation is kept to a minimum on the running server. Application code is written as to a normal pool; callers can't assume they will be dealing with the same instance in invocations in different threads. However, state can be relied on during the operations of a single thread: for example, if one caller makes repeated calls on the AOP proxy. Cleanup of thread-bound objects is performed on BeanFactory destruction, calling their DisposableBean.destroy() method if available. Be aware that many thread-bound objects can be around until the application actually shuts down.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/aop/target/ThreadLocalTargetSource.html

Implements the Refreshable interface in order to allow for explicit control over the refresh status.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/aop/target/dynamic/AbstractRefreshableTargetSource.html
BeanFactoryRefreshableTargetSource	A										<section class="prog__container">Refreshable TargetSource that fetches fresh target beans from a BeanFactory.

In addition, the visitXInsn and visitLabel methods must be called in the sequential order of the bytecode instructions of the visited code, visitInsnAnnotation must be called after the annotated instruction, visitTryCatchBlock must be called before the labels passed as arguments have been visited, visitTryCatchBlockAnnotation must be called after the corresponding try catch block has been visited, and the visitLocalVariable, visitLocalVariableAnnotation and visitLineNumber methods must be called after the labels passed as arguments have been visited.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/asm/MethodVisitor.html
Opcodes	A										<section class="prog__container">Defines the JVM opcodes, access flags and array type codes.

Likewise for LDC, automatically replaced by LDC_W or LDC2_W when necessary, WIDE, GOTO_W and JSR_W.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/asm/Opcodes.html
SpringAsmInfo	A										<section class="prog__container">Utility class exposing constants related to Spring's internal repackaging of the ASM bytecode manipulation library (currently based on version 5.0). See package-level javadocs for more information on org.springframework.asm.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/asm/SpringAsmInfo.html
Type	A										<section class="prog__container">A Java field or method type. This class can be used to make it easier to manipulate type and method descriptors.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/asm/Type.html
TypePath	A										<section class="prog__container">The path to a type argument, wildcard bound, array element type, or static inner type within an enclosing type.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/asm/TypePath.html
TypeReference	A										<section class="prog__container">A reference to a type appearing in a class, field or method declaration, or on an instruction. Such a reference designates the part of the class where the referenced type is appearing (e.g. an 'extends', 'implements' or 'throws' clause, a 'new' instruction, a 'catch' clause, a type cast, a local variable declaration, etc).</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/asm/TypeReference.html
AbstractNestablePropertyAccessor	A										<section class="prog__container">A basic ConfigurablePropertyAccessor that provides the necessary infrastructure for all typical use cases. This accessor will convert collection and array values to the corresponding target collections or arrays, if necessary. Custom property editors that deal with collections or arrays can either be written via PropertyEditor's setValue, or against a comma-delimited String via setAsText, as String arrays are converted in such a format if the array itself is not assignable.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/AbstractNestablePropertyAccessor.html
AbstractNestablePropertyAccessor.PropertyHandler	A										<section class="prog__container">Handle a given property.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/AbstractNestablePropertyAccessor.PropertyHandler.html
AbstractPropertyAccessor	A										<section class="prog__container">Abstract implementation of the PropertyAccessor interface. Provides base implementations of all convenience methods, with the implementation of actual property access left to subclasses.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/AbstractPropertyAccessor.html
BeanInfoFactory	A										<section class="prog__container">Strategy interface for creating BeanInfo instances for Spring beans. Can be used to plug in custom bean property resolution strategies (e.g. for other languages on the JVM) or more efficient BeanInfo retrieval algorithms. BeanInfoFactories are instantiated by the CachedIntrospectionResults, by using the SpringFactoriesLoader utility class. When a BeanInfo is to be created, the CachedIntrospectionResults will iterate through the discovered factories, calling getBeanInfo(Class) on each one. If null is returned, the next factory will be queried. If none of the factories support the class, a standard BeanInfo will be created as a default. Note that the SpringFactoriesLoader sorts the BeanInfoFactory instances by @Order, so that ones with a higher precedence come first.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/BeanInfoFactory.html
BeanInstantiationException	A										<section class="prog__container">Exception thrown when instantiation of a bean failed. Carries the offending bean class.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/BeanInstantiationException.html
BeanMetadataAttribute	A										<section class="prog__container">Holder for a key-value style attribute that is part of a bean definition. Keeps track of the definition source in addition to the key-value pair.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/BeanMetadataAttribute.html
BeanMetadataAttributeAccessor	A										<section class="prog__container">Extension of AttributeAccessorSupport, holding attributes as BeanMetadataAttribute objects in order to keep track of the definition source.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/BeanMetadataAttributeAccessor.html
BeanMetadataElement	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface to be implemented by bean metadata elements that carry a configuration source object.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/BeanMetadataElement.html
BeansException	A										<section class="prog__container">Abstract superclass for all exceptions thrown in the beans package and subpackages. Note that this is a runtime (unchecked) exception. Beans exceptions are usually fatal; there is no reason for them to be checked.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/BeansException.html
BeanUtils	A										<section class="prog__container">Static convenience methods for JavaBeans: for instantiating beans, checking bean property types, copying bean properties, etc. Mainly for use within the framework, but to some degree also useful for application classes.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/BeanUtils.html
BeanWrapper	A										<section class="prog__container">The central interface of Spring's low-level JavaBeans infrastructure. Typically not used directly but rather implicitly via a BeanFactory or a DataBinder. Provides operations to analyze and manipulate standard JavaBeans: the ability to get and set property values (individually or in bulk), get property descriptors, and query the readability/writability of properties. This interface supports nested properties enabling the setting of properties on subproperties to an unlimited depth. A BeanWrapper's default for the "extractOldValueForEditor" setting is "false", to avoid side effects caused by getter method invocations. Turn this to "true" to expose present property values to custom editors.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/BeanWrapper.html
BeanWrapperImpl	A										<section class="prog__container">Default BeanWrapper implementation that should be sufficient for all typical use cases. Caches introspection results for efficiency. Note: Auto-registers default property editors from the org.springframework.beans.propertyeditors package, which apply in addition to the JDK's standard PropertyEditors. Applications can call the PropertyEditorRegistrySupport.registerCustomEditor(Class, java.beans.PropertyEditor) method to register an editor for a particular instance (i.e. they are not shared across the application). See the base class PropertyEditorRegistrySupport for details. NOTE: As of Spring 2.5, this is - for almost all purposes - an internal class. It is just public in order to allow for access from other framework packages. For standard application access purposes, use the PropertyAccessorFactory.forBeanPropertyAccess(java.lang.Object) factory method instead.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/BeanWrapperImpl.html
CachedIntrospectionResults	A										<section class="prog__container">Internal class that caches JavaBeans PropertyDescriptor information for a Java class. Not intended for direct use by application code. Necessary for own caching of descriptors within the application's ClassLoader, rather than rely on the JDK's system-wide BeanInfo cache (in order to avoid leaks on ClassLoader shutdown). Information is cached statically, so we don't need to create new objects of this class for every JavaBean we manipulate. Hence, this class implements the factory design pattern, using a private constructor and a static forClass(Class) factory method to obtain instances. Note that for caching to work effectively, some preconditions need to be met: Prefer an arrangement where the Spring jars live in the same ClassLoader as the application classes, which allows for clean caching along with the application's lifecycle in any case. For a web application, consider declaring a local IntrospectorCleanupListener in web.xml in case of a multi-ClassLoader layout, which will allow for effective caching as well. In case of a non-clean ClassLoader arrangement without a cleanup listener having been set up, this class will fall back to a weak-reference-based caching model that recreates much-requested entries every time the garbage collector removed them. In such a scenario, consider the IGNORE_BEANINFO_PROPERTY_NAME system property.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/CachedIntrospectionResults.html
ConfigurablePropertyAccessor	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface that encapsulates configuration methods for a PropertyAccessor. Also extends the PropertyEditorRegistry interface, which defines methods for PropertyEditor management. Serves as base interface for BeanWrapper.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/ConfigurablePropertyAccessor.html
ConversionNotSupportedException	A										<section class="prog__container">Exception thrown when no suitable editor or converter can be found for a bean property.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/ConversionNotSupportedException.html
DirectFieldAccessor	A										<section class="prog__container">ConfigurablePropertyAccessor implementation that directly accesses instance fields. Allows for direct binding to fields instead of going through JavaBean setters. As of Spring 4.2, the vast majority of the BeanWrapper features have been merged to AbstractPropertyAccessor, which means that property traversal as well as collections and map access is now supported here as well. A DirectFieldAccessor's default for the "extractOldValueForEditor" setting is "true", since a field can always be read without side effects.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/DirectFieldAccessor.html
ExtendedBeanInfoFactory	A										<section class="prog__container">BeanInfoFactory implementation that evaluates whether bean classes have "non-standard" JavaBeans setter methods and are thus candidates for introspection by Spring's (package-visible) ExtendedBeanInfo implementation. Ordered at Ordered.LOWEST_PRECEDENCE to allow other user-defined BeanInfoFactory types to take precedence.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/ExtendedBeanInfoFactory.html
FatalBeanException	A										<section class="prog__container">Thrown on an unrecoverable problem encountered in the beans packages or sub-packages, e.g. bad class or field.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/FatalBeanException.html

MethodInvocationException	A										<section class="prog__container">Thrown when a bean property getter or setter method throws an exception, analogous to an InvocationTargetException.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/MethodInvocationException.html
MutablePropertyValues	A										<section class="prog__container">Default implementation of the PropertyValues interface. Allows simple manipulation of properties, and provides constructors to support deep copy and construction from a Map.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/MutablePropertyValues.html
NotReadablePropertyException	A										<section class="prog__container">Exception thrown on an attempt to get the value of a property that isn't readable, because there's no getter method.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/NotReadablePropertyException.html
NotWritablePropertyException	A										<section class="prog__container">Exception thrown on an attempt to set the value of a property that is not writable (typically because there is no setter method).</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/NotWritablePropertyException.html
NullValueInNestedPathException	A										<section class="prog__container">Exception thrown when navigation of a valid nested property path encounters a NullPointerException. For example, navigating "spouse.age" could fail because the spouse property of the target object has a null value.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/NullValueInNestedPathException.html

PropertyAccessorFactory	A										<section class="prog__container">Simple factory facade for obtaining PropertyAccessor instances, in particular for BeanWrapper instances. Conceals the actual target implementation classes and their extended public signature.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/PropertyAccessorFactory.html
PropertyAccessorUtils	A										<section class="prog__container">Utility methods for classes that perform bean property access according to the PropertyAccessor interface.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/PropertyAccessorUtils.html
PropertyBatchUpdateException	A										<section class="prog__container">Combined exception, composed of individual PropertyAccessException instances. An object of this class is created at the beginning of the binding process, and errors added to it as necessary. The binding process continues when it encounters application-level PropertyAccessExceptions, applying those changes that can be applied and storing rejected changes in an object of this class.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/PropertyBatchUpdateException.html
PropertyEditorRegistrar	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface for strategies that register custom property editors with a property editor registry. This is particularly useful when you need to use the same set of property editors in several different situations: write a corresponding registrar and reuse that in each case.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/PropertyEditorRegistrar.html
PropertyEditorRegistry	A										<section class="prog__container">Encapsulates methods for registering JavaBeans PropertyEditors. This is the central interface that a PropertyEditorRegistrar operates on. Extended by BeanWrapper; implemented by BeanWrapperImpl and DataBinder.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/PropertyEditorRegistry.html
PropertyEditorRegistrySupport	A										<section class="prog__container">Base implementation of the PropertyEditorRegistry interface. Provides management of default editors and custom editors. Mainly serves as base class for BeanWrapperImpl.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/PropertyEditorRegistrySupport.html
PropertyMatches	A										<section class="prog__container">Helper class for calculating property matches, according to a configurable distance. Provide the list of potential matches and an easy way to generate an error message. Works for both java bean properties and fields.  Mainly for use within the framework and in particular the binding facility</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/PropertyMatches.html
PropertyValue	A										<section class="prog__container">Object to hold information and value for an individual bean property. Using an object here, rather than just storing all properties in a map keyed by property name, allows for more flexibility, and the ability to handle indexed properties etc in an optimized way. Note that the value doesn't need to be the final required type: A BeanWrapper implementation should handle any necessary conversion, as this object doesn't know anything about the objects it will be applied to.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/PropertyValue.html
PropertyValues	A										<section class="prog__container">Holder containing one or more PropertyValue objects, typically comprising one update for a specific target bean.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/PropertyValues.html
PropertyValuesEditor	A										<section class="prog__container">Editor for a PropertyValues object. The required format is defined in the Properties documentation. Each property must be on a new line. The present implementation relies on a PropertiesEditor underneath.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/PropertyValuesEditor.html
SimpleTypeConverter	A										<section class="prog__container">Simple implementation of the TypeConverter interface that does not operate on a specific target object. This is an alternative to using a full-blown BeanWrapperImpl instance for arbitrary type conversion needs, while using the very same conversion algorithm (including delegation to PropertyEditor and ConversionService) underneath. Note: Due to its reliance on PropertyEditors, SimpleTypeConverter is not thread-safe. Use a separate instance for each thread.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/SimpleTypeConverter.html
TypeConverter	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface that defines type conversion methods. Typically (but not necessarily) implemented in conjunction with the PropertyEditorRegistry interface. Note: Since TypeConverter implementations are typically based on PropertyEditors which aren't thread-safe, TypeConverters themselves are not to be considered as thread-safe either.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/TypeConverter.html
TypeConverterSupport	A										<section class="prog__container">Base implementation of the TypeConverter interface, using a package-private delegate. Mainly serves as base class for BeanWrapperImpl.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/TypeConverterSupport.html

Aware	A										<section class="prog__container">Marker superinterface indicating that a bean is eligible to be notified by the Spring container of a particular framework object through a callback-style method. Actual method signature is determined by individual subinterfaces, but should typically consist of just one void-returning method that accepts a single argument. Note that merely implementing Aware provides no default functionality. Rather, processing must be done explicitly, for example in a BeanPostProcessor. Refer to ApplicationContextAwareProcessor and AbstractAutowireCapableBeanFactory for examples of processing *Aware interface callbacks.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/Aware.html
BeanClassLoaderAware	A										<section class="prog__container">Callback that allows a bean to be aware of the bean class loader; that is, the class loader used by the present bean factory to load bean classes. This is mainly intended to be implemented by framework classes which have to pick up application classes by name despite themselves potentially being loaded from a shared class loader. For a list of all bean lifecycle methods, see the BeanFactory javadocs.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/BeanClassLoaderAware.html
BeanCreationException	A										<section class="prog__container">Exception thrown when a BeanFactory encounters an error when attempting to create a bean from a bean definition.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/BeanCreationException.html
BeanCreationNotAllowedException	A										<section class="prog__container">Exception thrown in case of a bean being requested despite bean creation currently not being allowed (for example, during the shutdown phase of a bean factory).</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/BeanCreationNotAllowedException.html
BeanCurrentlyInCreationException	A										<section class="prog__container">Exception thrown in case of a reference to a bean that's currently in creation.

BeanDefinitionStoreException	A										<section class="prog__container">Exception thrown when a BeanFactory encounters an invalid bean definition: e.g. in case of incomplete or contradictory bean metadata.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/BeanDefinitionStoreException.html
BeanExpressionException	A										<section class="prog__container">Exception that indicates an expression evaluation attempt having failed.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/BeanExpressionException.html
BeanFactory	A										<section class="prog__container">The root interface for accessing a Spring bean container. This is the basic client view of a bean container; further interfaces such as ListableBeanFactory and ConfigurableBeanFactory are available for specific purposes. This interface is implemented by objects that hold a number of bean definitions, each uniquely identified by a String name. Depending on the bean definition, the factory will return either an independent instance of a contained object (the Prototype design pattern), or a single shared instance (a superior alternative to the Singleton design pattern, in which the instance is a singleton in the scope of the factory). Which type of instance will be returned depends on the bean factory configuration: the API is the same. Since Spring 2.0, further scopes are available depending on the concrete application context (e.g. "request" and "session" scopes in a web environment). The point of this approach is that the BeanFactory is a central registry of application components, and centralizes configuration of application components (no more do individual objects need to read properties files, for example). See chapters 4 and 11 of "Expert One-on-One J2EE Design and Development" for a discussion of the benefits of this approach. Note that it is generally better to rely on Dependency Injection ("push" configuration) to configure application objects through setters or constructors, rather than use any form of "pull" configuration like a BeanFactory lookup. Spring's Dependency Injection functionality is implemented using this BeanFactory interface and its subinterfaces. Normally a BeanFactory will load bean definitions stored in a configuration source (such as an XML document), and use the org.springframework.beans package to configure the beans. However, an implementation could simply return Java objects it creates as necessary directly in Java code. There are no constraints on how the definitions could be stored: LDAP, RDBMS, XML, properties file, etc. Implementations are encouraged to support references amongst beans (Dependency Injection). In contrast to the methods in ListableBeanFactory, all of the operations in this interface will also check parent factories if this is a HierarchicalBeanFactory. If a bean is not found in this factory instance, the immediate parent factory will be asked. Beans in this factory instance are supposed to override beans of the same name in any parent factory. Bean factory implementations should support the standard bean lifecycle interfaces as far as possible. The full set of initialization methods and their standard order is: BeanNameAware's setBeanNameBeanClassLoaderAware's setBeanClassLoaderBeanFactoryAware's setBeanFactoryEnvironmentAware's setEnvironmentEmbeddedValueResolverAware's setEmbeddedValueResolverResourceLoaderAware's setResourceLoader (only applicable when running in an application context) ApplicationEventPublisherAware's setApplicationEventPublisher (only applicable when running in an application context) MessageSourceAware's setMessageSource (only applicable when running in an application context) ApplicationContextAware's setApplicationContext (only applicable when running in an application context) ServletContextAware's setServletContext (only applicable when running in a web application context) postProcessBeforeInitialization methods of BeanPostProcessors InitializingBean's afterPropertiesSeta custom init-method definition postProcessAfterInitialization methods of BeanPostProcessors On shutdown of a bean factory, the following lifecycle methods apply: postProcessBeforeDestruction methods of DestructionAwareBeanPostProcessors DisposableBean's destroya custom destroy-method definition </section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/BeanFactory.html
BeanFactoryAware	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface to be implemented by beans that wish to be aware of their owning BeanFactory. For example, beans can look up collaborating beans via the factory (Dependency Lookup). Note that most beans will choose to receive references to collaborating beans via corresponding bean properties or constructor arguments (Dependency Injection). For a list of all bean lifecycle methods, see the BeanFactory javadocs.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/BeanFactoryAware.html
BeanFactoryUtils	A										<section class="prog__container">Convenience methods operating on bean factories, in particular on the ListableBeanFactory interface. Returns bean counts, bean names or bean instances, taking into account the nesting hierarchy of a bean factory (which the methods defined on the ListableBeanFactory interface don't, in contrast to the methods defined on the BeanFactory interface).</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/BeanFactoryUtils.html
BeanInitializationException	A										<section class="prog__container">Exception that a bean implementation is suggested to throw if its own factory-aware initialization code fails. BeansExceptions thrown by bean factory methods themselves should simply be propagated as-is. Note that afterPropertiesSet() or a custom "init-method" can throw any exception.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/BeanInitializationException.html
BeanIsAbstractException	A										<section class="prog__container">Exception thrown when a bean instance has been requested for a bean definition which has been marked as abstract.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/BeanIsAbstractException.html
BeanIsNotAFactoryException	A										<section class="prog__container">Exception thrown when a bean is not a factory, but a user tries to get at the factory for the given bean name. Whether a bean is a factory is determined by whether it implements the FactoryBean interface.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/BeanIsNotAFactoryException.html
BeanNameAware	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface to be implemented by beans that want to be aware of their bean name in a bean factory. Note that it is not usually recommended that an object depend on its bean name, as this represents a potentially brittle dependence on external configuration, as well as a possibly unnecessary dependence on a Spring API. For a list of all bean lifecycle methods, see the BeanFactory javadocs.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/BeanNameAware.html
BeanNotOfRequiredTypeException	A										<section class="prog__container">Thrown when a bean doesn't match the expected type.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/BeanNotOfRequiredTypeException.html
CannotLoadBeanClassException	A										<section class="prog__container">Exception thrown when the BeanFactory cannot load the specified class of a given bean.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/CannotLoadBeanClassException.html
DisposableBean	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface to be implemented by beans that want to release resources on destruction. A BeanFactory is supposed to invoke the destroy method if it disposes a cached singleton. An application context is supposed to dispose all of its singletons on close. An alternative to implementing DisposableBean is specifying a custom destroy-method, for example in an XML bean definition. For a list of all bean lifecycle methods, see the BeanFactory javadocs.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/DisposableBean.html
FactoryBean	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface to be implemented by objects used within a BeanFactory which are themselves factories. If a bean implements this interface, it is used as a factory for an object to expose, not directly as a bean instance that will be exposed itself. NB: A bean that implements this interface cannot be used as a normal bean. A FactoryBean is defined in a bean style, but the object exposed for bean references (getObject() is always the object that it creates. FactoryBeans can support singletons and prototypes, and can either create objects lazily on demand or eagerly on startup. The SmartFactoryBean interface allows for exposing more fine-grained behavioral metadata. This interface is heavily used within the framework itself, for example for the AOP ProxyFactoryBean or the JndiObjectFactoryBean. It can be used for application components as well; however, this is not common outside of infrastructure code. NOTE: FactoryBean objects participate in the containing BeanFactory's synchronization of bean creation. There is usually no need for internal synchronization other than for purposes of lazy initialization within the FactoryBean itself (or the like).</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/FactoryBean.html
FactoryBeanNotInitializedException	A										<section class="prog__container">Exception to be thrown from a FactoryBean's getObject() method if the bean is not fully initialized yet, for example because it is involved in a circular reference. Note: A circular reference with a FactoryBean cannot be solved by eagerly caching singleton instances like with normal beans. The reason is that every FactoryBean needs to be fully initialized before it can return the created bean, while only specific normal beans need to be initialized - that is, if a collaborating bean actually invokes them on initialization instead of just storing the reference.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/FactoryBeanNotInitializedException.html
HierarchicalBeanFactory	A										<section class="prog__container">Sub-interface implemented by bean factories that can be part of a hierarchy. The corresponding setParentBeanFactory method for bean factories that allow setting the parent in a configurable fashion can be found in the ConfigurableBeanFactory interface.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/HierarchicalBeanFactory.html
InitializingBean	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface to be implemented by beans that need to react once all their properties have been set by a BeanFactory: for example, to perform custom initialization, or merely to check that all mandatory properties have been set. An alternative to implementing InitializingBean is specifying a custom init-method, for example in an XML bean definition. For a list of all bean lifecycle methods, see the BeanFactory javadocs.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/InitializingBean.html
InjectionPoint	A										<section class="prog__container">A simple descriptor for an injection point, pointing to a method/constructor parameter or a field. Exposed by UnsatisfiedDependencyException.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/InjectionPoint.html
ListableBeanFactory	A										<section class="prog__container">Extension of the BeanFactory interface to be implemented by bean factories that can enumerate all their bean instances, rather than attempting bean lookup by name one by one as requested by clients. BeanFactory implementations that preload all their bean definitions (such as XML-based factories) may implement this interface. If this is a HierarchicalBeanFactory, the return values will not take any BeanFactory hierarchy into account, but will relate only to the beans defined in the current factory. Use the BeanFactoryUtils helper class to consider beans in ancestor factories too. The methods in this interface will just respect bean definitions of this factory. They will ignore any singleton beans that have been registered by other means like ConfigurableBeanFactory's registerSingleton method, with the exception of getBeanNamesOfType and getBeansOfType which will check such manually registered singletons too. Of course, BeanFactory's getBean does allow transparent access to such special beans as well. However, in typical scenarios, all beans will be defined by external bean definitions anyway, so most applications don't need to worry about this differentiation. NOTE: With the exception of getBeanDefinitionCount and containsBeanDefinition, the methods in this interface are not designed for frequent invocation. Implementations may be slow.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/ListableBeanFactory.html
NamedBean	A										<section class="prog__container">Counterpart of BeanNameAware. Returns the bean name of an object. This interface can be introduced to avoid a brittle dependence on bean name in objects used with Spring IoC and Spring AOP.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/NamedBean.html
NoSuchBeanDefinitionException	A										<section class="prog__container">Exception thrown when a BeanFactory is asked for a bean instance for which it cannot find a definition. This may point to a non-existing bean, a non-unique bean, or a manually registered singleton instance without an associated bean definition.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/NoSuchBeanDefinitionException.html
NoUniqueBeanDefinitionException	A										<section class="prog__container">Exception thrown when a BeanFactory is asked for a bean instance for which multiple matching candidates have been found when only one matching bean was expected.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/NoUniqueBeanDefinitionException.html
ObjectFactory	A										<section class="prog__container">Defines a factory which can return an Object instance (possibly shared or independent) when invoked. This interface is typically used to encapsulate a generic factory which returns a new instance (prototype) of some target object on each invocation. This interface is similar to FactoryBean, but implementations of the latter are normally meant to be defined as SPI instances in a BeanFactory, while implementations of this class are normally meant to be fed as an API to other beans (through injection). As such, the getObject() method has different exception handling behavior.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/ObjectFactory.html
ObjectProvider	A										<section class="prog__container">A variant of ObjectFactory designed specifically for injection points, allowing for programmatic optionality and lenient not-unique handling.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/ObjectProvider.html
SmartFactoryBean	A										<section class="prog__container">Extension of the FactoryBean interface. Implementations may indicate whether they always return independent instances, for the case where their FactoryBean.isSingleton() implementation returning false does not clearly indicate independent instances. Plain FactoryBean implementations which do not implement this extended interface are simply assumed to always return independent instances if their FactoryBean.isSingleton() implementation returns false; the exposed object is only accessed on demand. NOTE: This interface is a special purpose interface, mainly for internal use within the framework and within collaborating frameworks. In general, application-provided FactoryBeans should simply implement the plain FactoryBean interface. New methods might be added to this extended interface even in point releases.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/SmartFactoryBean.html
SmartInitializingSingleton	A										<section class="prog__container">Callback interface triggered at the end of the singleton pre-instantiation phase during BeanFactory bootstrap. This interface can be implemented by singleton beans in order to perform some initialization after the regular singleton instantiation algorithm, avoiding side effects with accidental early initialization (e.g. from ListableBeanFactory.getBeansOfType(java.lang.Class<T>) calls). In that sense, it is an alternative to InitializingBean which gets triggered right at the end of a bean's local construction phase. This callback variant is somewhat similar to ContextRefreshedEvent but doesn't require an implementation of ApplicationListener, with no need to filter context references across a context hierarchy etc. It also implies a more minimal dependency on just the beans package and is being honored by standalone ListableBeanFactory implementations, not just in an ApplicationContext environment. NOTE: If you intend to start/manage asynchronous tasks, preferably implement Lifecycle instead which offers a richer model for runtime management and allows for phased startup/shutdown.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/SmartInitializingSingleton.html
UnsatisfiedDependencyException	A										<section class="prog__container">Exception thrown when a bean depends on other beans or simple properties that were not specified in the bean factory definition, although dependency checking was enabled.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/UnsatisfiedDependencyException.html
BeanFactoryLocator	A										<section class="prog__container">Defines a contract for the lookup, use, and release of a BeanFactory, or a BeanFactory subclass such as an ApplicationContext. Where this interface is implemented as a singleton class such as SingletonBeanFactoryLocator, the Spring team strongly suggests that it be used sparingly and with caution. By far the vast majority of the code inside an application is best written in a Dependency Injection style, where that code is served out of a BeanFactory/ApplicationContext container, and has its own dependencies supplied by the container when it is created. However, even such a singleton implementation sometimes has its use in the small glue layers of code that is sometimes needed to tie other code together. For example, third party code may try to construct new objects directly, without the ability to force it to get these objects out of a BeanFactory. If the object constructed by the third party code is just a small stub or proxy, which then uses an implementation of this class to get a BeanFactory from which it gets the real object, to which it delegates, then proper Dependency Injection has been achieved. As another example, in a complex J2EE app with multiple layers, with each layer having its own ApplicationContext definition (in a hierarchy), a class like SingletonBeanFactoryLocator may be used to demand load these contexts.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/access/BeanFactoryLocator.html
BeanFactoryReference	A										<section class="prog__container">Used to track a reference to a BeanFactory obtained through a BeanFactoryLocator. It is safe to call release() multiple times, but getFactory() must not be called after calling release.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/access/BeanFactoryReference.html
BootstrapException	A										<section class="prog__container">Exception thrown if a bean factory could not be loaded by a bootstrap class.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/access/BootstrapException.html
SingletonBeanFactoryLocator	A										<section class="prog__container">Keyed-singleton implementation of BeanFactoryLocator, which accesses shared Spring BeanFactory instances.Please see the warning in BeanFactoryLocator's javadoc about appropriate usage of singleton style BeanFactoryLocator implementations. It is the opinion of the Spring team that the use of this class and similar classes is unnecessary except (sometimes) for a small amount of glue code. Excessive usage will lead to code that is more tightly coupled, and harder to modify or test.In this implementation, a BeanFactory is built up from one or more XML definition file fragments, accessed as resources. The default resource name searched for is 'classpath*:beanRefFactory.xml', with the Spring-standard 'classpath*:' prefix ensuring that if the classpath contains multiple copies of this file (perhaps one in each component jar) they will be combined. To override the default resource name, instead of using the no-arg getInstance() method, use the getInstance(String selector) variant, which will treat the 'selector' argument as the resource name to search for.The purpose of this 'outer' BeanFactory is to create and hold a copy of one or more 'inner' BeanFactory or ApplicationContext instances, and allow those to be obtained either directly or via an alias. As such, this class provides both singleton style access to one or more BeanFactories/ApplicationContexts, and also a level of indirection, allowing multiple pieces of code, which are not able to work in a Dependency Injection fashion, to refer to and use the same target BeanFactory/ApplicationContext instance(s), by different names.Consider an example application scenario: com.mycompany.myapp.util.applicationContext.xml - ApplicationContext definition file which defines beans for 'util' layer. com.mycompany.myapp.dataaccess-applicationContext.xml - ApplicationContext definition file which defines beans for 'data access' layer. Depends on the above. com.mycompany.myapp.services.applicationContext.xml - ApplicationContext definition file which defines beans for 'services' layer. Depends on the above. In an ideal scenario, these would be combined to create one ApplicationContext, or created as three hierarchical ApplicationContexts, by one piece of code somewhere at application startup (perhaps a Servlet filter), from which all other code in the application would flow, obtained as beans from the context(s). However when third party code enters into the picture, things can get problematic. If the third party code needs to create user classes, which should normally be obtained from a Spring BeanFactory/ApplicationContext, but can handle only newInstance() style object creation, then some extra work is required to actually access and use object from a BeanFactory/ApplicationContext. One solutions is to make the class created by the third party code be just a stub or proxy, which gets the real object from a BeanFactory/ApplicationContext, and delegates to it. However, it is not normally workable for the stub to create the BeanFactory on each use, as depending on what is inside it, that can be an expensive operation. Additionally, there is a fairly tight coupling between the stub and the name of the definition resource for the BeanFactory/ApplicationContext. This is where SingletonBeanFactoryLocator comes in. The stub can obtain a SingletonBeanFactoryLocator instance, which is effectively a singleton, and ask it for an appropriate BeanFactory. A subsequent invocation (assuming the same class loader is involved) by the stub or another piece of code, will obtain the same instance. The simple aliasing mechanism allows the context to be asked for by a name which is appropriate for (or describes) the user. The deployer can match alias names to actual context names. Another use of SingletonBeanFactoryLocator, is to demand-load/use one or more BeanFactories/ApplicationContexts. Because the definition can contain one of more BeanFactories/ApplicationContexts, which can be independent or in a hierarchy, if they are set to lazy-initialize, they will only be created when actually requested for use. Given the above-mentioned three ApplicationContexts, consider the simplest SingletonBeanFactoryLocator usage scenario, where there is only one single beanRefFactory.xml definition file: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <!DOCTYPE beans PUBLIC "-//SPRING//DTD BEAN 2.0//EN" "http://www.springframework.org/dtd/spring-beans-2.0.dtd"> <beans>   <bean id="com.mycompany.myapp"         class="org.springframework.context.support.ClassPathXmlApplicationContext">     <constructor-arg>       <list>         <value>com/mycompany/myapp/util/applicationContext.xml</value>         <value>com/mycompany/myapp/dataaccess/applicationContext.xml</value>         <value>com/mycompany/myapp/dataaccess/services.xml</value>       </list>     </constructor-arg>   </bean> </beans>  The client code is as simple as:  BeanFactoryLocator bfl = SingletonBeanFactoryLocator.getInstance(); BeanFactoryReference bf = bfl.useBeanFactory("com.mycompany.myapp"); // now use some bean from factory MyClass zed = bf.getFactory().getBean("mybean");  Another relatively simple variation of the beanRefFactory.xml definition file could be: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <!DOCTYPE beans PUBLIC "-//SPRING//DTD BEAN 2.0//EN" "http://www.springframework.org/dtd/spring-beans-2.0.dtd"> <beans>   <bean id="com.mycompany.myapp.util" lazy-init="true"         class="org.springframework.context.support.ClassPathXmlApplicationContext">     <constructor-arg>       <value>com/mycompany/myapp/util/applicationContext.xml</value>     </constructor-arg>   </bean>   <!-- child of above -->   <bean id="com.mycompany.myapp.dataaccess" lazy-init="true"         class="org.springframework.context.support.ClassPathXmlApplicationContext">     <constructor-arg>       <list><value>com/mycompany/myapp/dataaccess/applicationContext.xml</value></list>     </constructor-arg>     <constructor-arg>       <ref bean="com.mycompany.myapp.util"/>     </constructor-arg>   </bean>   <!-- child of above -->   <bean id="com.mycompany.myapp.services" lazy-init="true"         class="org.springframework.context.support.ClassPathXmlApplicationContext">     <constructor-arg>       <list><value>com/mycompany/myapp/dataaccess.services.xml</value></value>     </constructor-arg>     <constructor-arg>       <ref bean="com.mycompany.myapp.dataaccess"/>     </constructor-arg>   </bean>   <!-- define an alias -->   <bean id="com.mycompany.myapp.mypackage"         class="java.lang.String">     <constructor-arg>       <value>com.mycompany.myapp.services</value>     </constructor-arg>   </bean> </beans> In this example, there is a hierarchy of three contexts created. The (potential) advantage is that if the lazy flag is set to true, a context will only be created if it's actually used. If there is some code that is only needed some of the time, this mechanism can save some resources. Additionally, an alias to the last context has been created. Aliases allow usage of the idiom where client code asks for a context with an id which represents the package or module the code is in, and the actual definition file(s) for the SingletonBeanFactoryLocator maps that id to a real context id. A final example is more complex, with a beanRefFactory.xml for every module. All the files are automatically combined to create the final definition. beanRefFactory.xml file inside jar for util module: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <!DOCTYPE beans PUBLIC "-//SPRING//DTD BEAN 2.0//EN" "http://www.springframework.org/dtd/spring-beans-2.0.dtd"> <beans>   <bean id="com.mycompany.myapp.util" lazy-init="true"        class="org.springframework.context.support.ClassPathXmlApplicationContext">     <constructor-arg>       <value>com/mycompany/myapp/util/applicationContext.xml</value>     </constructor-arg>   </bean> </beans> beanRefFactory.xml file inside jar for data-access module:<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <!DOCTYPE beans PUBLIC "-//SPRING//DTD BEAN 2.0//EN" "http://www.springframework.org/dtd/spring-beans-2.0.dtd"> <beans>   <!-- child of util -->   <bean id="com.mycompany.myapp.dataaccess" lazy-init="true"        class="org.springframework.context.support.ClassPathXmlApplicationContext">     <constructor-arg>       <list><value>com/mycompany/myapp/dataaccess/applicationContext.xml</value></list>     </constructor-arg>     <constructor-arg>       <ref bean="com.mycompany.myapp.util"/>     </constructor-arg>   </bean> </beans> beanRefFactory.xml file inside jar for services module: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <!DOCTYPE beans PUBLIC "-//SPRING//DTD BEAN 2.0//EN" "http://www.springframework.org/dtd/spring-beans-2.0.dtd"> <beans>   <!-- child of data-access -->   <bean id="com.mycompany.myapp.services" lazy-init="true"        class="org.springframework.context.support.ClassPathXmlApplicationContext">     <constructor-arg>       <list><value>com/mycompany/myapp/dataaccess/services.xml</value></list>     </constructor-arg>     <constructor-arg>       <ref bean="com.mycompany.myapp.dataaccess"/>     </constructor-arg>   </bean> </beans> beanRefFactory.xml file inside jar for mypackage module.

AnnotatedGenericBeanDefinition	A										<section class="prog__container">Extension of the GenericBeanDefinition class, adding support for annotation metadata exposed through the AnnotatedBeanDefinition interface. This GenericBeanDefinition variant is mainly useful for testing code that expects to operate on an AnnotatedBeanDefinition, for example strategy implementations in Spring's component scanning support (where the default definition class is ScannedGenericBeanDefinition, which also implements the AnnotatedBeanDefinition interface).</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/annotation/AnnotatedGenericBeanDefinition.html
AnnotationBeanWiringInfoResolver	A										<section class="prog__container">BeanWiringInfoResolver that uses the Configurable annotation to identify which classes need autowiring. The bean name to look up will be taken from the Configurable annotation if specified; otherwise the default will be the fully-qualified name of the class being configured.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/annotation/AnnotationBeanWiringInfoResolver.html
Autowire	A										<section class="prog__container">Enumeration determining autowiring status: that is, whether a bean should have its dependencies automatically injected by the Spring container using setter injection. This is a core concept in Spring DI. Available for use in annotation-based configurations, such as for the AspectJ AnnotationBeanConfigurer aspect.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/annotation/Autowire.html
Autowired	A										<section class="prog__container">Marks a constructor, field, setter method or config method as to be autowired by Spring's dependency injection facilities. Only one constructor (at max) of any given bean class may carry this annotation, indicating the constructor to autowire when used as a Spring bean. Such a constructor does not have to be public. Fields are injected right after construction of a bean, before any config methods are invoked. Such a config field does not have to be public. Config methods may have an arbitrary name and any number of arguments; each of those arguments will be autowired with a matching bean in the Spring container. Bean property setter methods are effectively just a special case of such a general config method. Such config methods do not have to be public. In the case of multiple argument methods, the 'required' parameter is applicable for all arguments. In case of a Collection or Map dependency type, the container will autowire all beans matching the declared value type. In case of a Map, the keys must be declared as type String and will be resolved to the corresponding bean names. Note that actual injection is performed through a BeanPostProcessor which in turn means that you cannot use @Autowired to inject references into BeanPostProcessor or BeanFactoryPostProcessor types. Please consult the javadoc for the AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor class (which, by default, checks for the presence of this annotation).</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/annotation/Autowired.html
AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor	A										<section class="prog__container">BeanPostProcessor implementation that autowires annotated fields, setter methods and arbitrary config methods. Such members to be injected are detected through a Java 5 annotation: by default, Spring's @Autowired and @Value annotations. Also supports JSR-330's @Inject annotation, if available, as a direct alternative to Spring's own @Autowired. Only one constructor (at max) of any given bean class may carry this annotation with the 'required' parameter set to true, indicating the constructor to autowire when used as a Spring bean. If multiple non-required constructors carry the annotation, they will be considered as candidates for autowiring. The constructor with the greatest number of dependencies that can be satisfied by matching beans in the Spring container will be chosen. If none of the candidates can be satisfied, then a default constructor (if present) will be used. An annotated constructor does not have to be public. Fields are injected right after construction of a bean, before any config methods are invoked. Such a config field does not have to be public. Config methods may have an arbitrary name and any number of arguments; each of those arguments will be autowired with a matching bean in the Spring container. Bean property setter methods are effectively just a special case of such a general config method. Config methods do not have to be public. Note: A default AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor will be registered by the "context:annotation-config" and "context:component-scan" XML tags. Remove or turn off the default annotation configuration there if you intend to specify a custom AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor bean definition. NOTE: Annotation injection will be performed before XML injection; thus the latter configuration will override the former for properties wired through both approaches. In addition to regular injection points as discussed above, this post-processor also handles Spring's @Lookup annotation which identifies lookup methods to be replaced by the container at runtime. This is essentially a type-safe version of getBean(Class, args) and getBean(String, args), See @Lookup's javadoc for details.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/annotation/AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor.html

Typically used with the AspectJ AnnotationBeanConfigurerAspect.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/annotation/Configurable.html
CustomAutowireConfigurer	A										<section class="prog__container">A BeanFactoryPostProcessor implementation that allows for convenient registration of custom autowire qualifier types.  <bean id="customAutowireConfigurer" class="org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.CustomAutowireConfigurer">   <property name="customQualifierTypes">     <set>       <value>mypackage.MyQualifier</value>     </set>   </property> </bean></section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/annotation/CustomAutowireConfigurer.html
InitDestroyAnnotationBeanPostProcessor	A										<section class="prog__container">BeanPostProcessor implementation that invokes annotated init and destroy methods. Allows for an annotation alternative to Spring's InitializingBean and DisposableBean callback interfaces. The actual annotation types that this post-processor checks for can be configured through the "initAnnotationType" and "destroyAnnotationType" properties. Any custom annotation can be used, since there are no required annotation attributes. Init and destroy annotations may be applied to methods of any visibility: public, package-protected, protected, or private. Multiple such methods may be annotated, but it is recommended to only annotate one single init method and destroy method, respectively. Spring's CommonAnnotationBeanPostProcessor supports the JSR-250 PostConstruct and PreDestroy annotations out of the box, as init annotation and destroy annotation, respectively. Furthermore, it also supports the Resource annotation for annotation-driven injection of named beans.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/annotation/InitDestroyAnnotationBeanPostProcessor.html
InjectionMetadata	A										<section class="prog__container">Internal class for managing injection metadata. Not intended for direct use in applications.

Lookup	A										<section class="prog__container">An annotation that indicates 'lookup' methods, to be overridden by the container to redirect them back to the BeanFactory for a getBean call. This is essentially an annotation-based version of the XML lookup-method attribute, resulting in the same runtime arrangement. The resolution of the target bean can either be based on the return type (getBean(Class)) or on a suggested bean name (getBean(String)), in both cases passing the method's arguments to the getBean call for applying them as target factory method arguments or constructor arguments. Such lookup methods can have default (stub) implementations that will simply get replaced by the container, or they can be declared as abstract - for the container to fill them in at runtime. In both cases, the container will generate runtime subclasses of the method's containing class via CGLIB, which is why such lookup methods can only work on beans that the container instantiates through regular constructors: i.e. lookup methods cannot get replaced on beans returned from factory methods where we cannot dynamically provide a subclass for them. Concrete limitations in typical Spring configuration scenarios: When used with component scanning or any other mechanism that filters out abstract beans, provide stub implementations of your lookup methods to be able to declare them as concrete classes. And please remember that lookup methods won't work on beans returned from @Bean methods in configuration classes; you'll have to resort to @Inject Provider&lt;TargetBean&gt; or the like instead.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/annotation/Lookup.html
Qualifier	A										<section class="prog__container">This annotation may be used on a field or parameter as a qualifier for candidate beans when autowiring. It may also be used to annotate other custom annotations that can then in turn be used as qualifiers.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/annotation/Qualifier.html
QualifierAnnotationAutowireCandidateResolver	A										<section class="prog__container">AutowireCandidateResolver implementation that matches bean definition qualifiers against qualifier annotations on the field or parameter to be autowired. Also supports suggested expression values through a value annotation. Also supports JSR-330's Qualifier annotation, if available.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/annotation/QualifierAnnotationAutowireCandidateResolver.html
Required	A										<section class="prog__container">Marks a method (typically a JavaBean setter method) as being 'required': that is, the setter method must be configured to be dependency-injected with a value. Please do consult the javadoc for the RequiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor class (which, by default, checks for the presence of this annotation).</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/annotation/Required.html
RequiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor	A										<section class="prog__container">BeanPostProcessor implementation that enforces required JavaBean properties to have been configured. Required bean properties are detected through a Java 5 annotation: by default, Spring's Required annotation. The motivation for the existence of this BeanPostProcessor is to allow developers to annotate the setter properties of their own classes with an arbitrary JDK 1.5 annotation to indicate that the container must check for the configuration of a dependency injected value. This neatly pushes responsibility for such checking onto the container (where it arguably belongs), and obviates the need (in part) for a developer to code a method that simply checks that all required properties have actually been set. Please note that an 'init' method may still need to implemented (and may still be desirable), because all that this class does is enforce that a 'required' property has actually been configured with a value. It does not check anything else... In particular, it does not check that a configured value is not null. Note: A default RequiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor will be registered by the "context:annotation-config" and "context:component-scan" XML tags. Remove or turn off the default annotation configuration there if you intend to specify a custom RequiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor bean definition.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/annotation/RequiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor.html
Value	A										<section class="prog__container">Annotation at the field or method/constructor parameter level that indicates a default value expression for the affected argument. Typically used for expression-driven dependency injection. Also supported for dynamic resolution of handler method parameters, e.g. in Spring MVC. A common use case is to assign default field values using "#{systemProperties.myProp}" style expressions. Note that actual processing of the @Value annotation is performed by a BeanPostProcessor which in turn means that you cannot use @Value within BeanPostProcessor or BeanFactoryPostProcessor types. Please consult the javadoc for the AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor class (which, by default, checks for the presence of this annotation).</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/annotation/Value.html

AbstractFactoryBean	A										<section class="prog__container">Simple template superclass for FactoryBean implementations that creates a singleton or a prototype object, depending on a flag. If the "singleton" flag is true (the default), this class will create the object that it creates exactly once on initialization and subsequently return said singleton instance on all calls to the getObject() method. Else, this class will create a new instance every time the getObject() method is invoked. Subclasses are responsible for implementing the abstract createInstance() template method to actually create the object(s) to expose.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/AbstractFactoryBean.html
AutowireCapableBeanFactory	A										<section class="prog__container">Extension of the BeanFactory interface to be implemented by bean factories that are capable of autowiring, provided that they want to expose this functionality for existing bean instances. This subinterface of BeanFactory is not meant to be used in normal application code: stick to BeanFactory or ListableBeanFactory for typical use cases. Integration code for other frameworks can leverage this interface to wire and populate existing bean instances that Spring does not control the lifecycle of. This is particularly useful for WebWork Actions and Tapestry Page objects, for example. Note that this interface is not implemented by ApplicationContext facades, as it is hardly ever used by application code. That said, it is available from an application context too, accessible through ApplicationContext's ApplicationContext.getAutowireCapableBeanFactory() method. You may also implement the BeanFactoryAware interface, which exposes the internal BeanFactory even when running in an ApplicationContext, to get access to an AutowireCapableBeanFactory: simply cast the passed-in BeanFactory to AutowireCapableBeanFactory.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/AutowireCapableBeanFactory.html
BeanDefinition	A										<section class="prog__container">A BeanDefinition describes a bean instance, which has property values, constructor argument values, and further information supplied by concrete implementations. This is just a minimal interface: The main intention is to allow a BeanFactoryPostProcessor such as PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer to introspect and modify property values and other bean metadata.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/BeanDefinition.html

BeanDefinitionVisitor	A										<section class="prog__container">Visitor class for traversing BeanDefinition objects, in particular the property values and constructor argument values contained in them, resolving bean metadata values. Used by PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer to parse all String values contained in a BeanDefinition, resolving any placeholders found.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/BeanDefinitionVisitor.html
BeanExpressionContext	A										<section class="prog__container">Context object for evaluating an expression within a bean definition.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/BeanExpressionContext.html
BeanExpressionResolver	A										<section class="prog__container">Strategy interface for resolving a value through evaluating it as an expression, if applicable. A raw BeanFactory does not contain a default implementation of this strategy. However, ApplicationContext implementations will provide expression support out of the box.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/BeanExpressionResolver.html
BeanFactoryPostProcessor	A										<section class="prog__container">Allows for custom modification of an application context's bean definitions, adapting the bean property values of the context's underlying bean factory. Application contexts can auto-detect BeanFactoryPostProcessor beans in their bean definitions and apply them before any other beans get created. Useful for custom config files targeted at system administrators that override bean properties configured in the application context. See PropertyResourceConfigurer and its concrete implementations for out-of-the-box solutions that address such configuration needs. A BeanFactoryPostProcessor may interact with and modify bean definitions, but never bean instances. Doing so may cause premature bean instantiation, violating the container and causing unintended side-effects. If bean instance interaction is required, consider implementing BeanPostProcessor instead.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/BeanFactoryPostProcessor.html
BeanPostProcessor	A										<section class="prog__container">Factory hook that allows for custom modification of new bean instances, e.g. checking for marker interfaces or wrapping them with proxies. ApplicationContexts can autodetect BeanPostProcessor beans in their bean definitions and apply them to any beans subsequently created. Plain bean factories allow for programmatic registration of post-processors, applying to all beans created through this factory. Typically, post-processors that populate beans via marker interfaces or the like will implement postProcessBeforeInitialization(java.lang.Object, java.lang.String), while post-processors that wrap beans with proxies will normally implement postProcessAfterInitialization(java.lang.Object, java.lang.String).</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/BeanPostProcessor.html
BeanReference	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface that exposes a reference to a bean name in an abstract fashion. This interface does not necessarily imply a reference to an actual bean instance; it just expresses a logical reference to the name of a bean. Serves as common interface implemented by any kind of bean reference holder, such as RuntimeBeanReference and RuntimeBeanNameReference.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/BeanReference.html
ConfigurableBeanFactory	A										<section class="prog__container">Configuration interface to be implemented by most bean factories. Provides facilities to configure a bean factory, in addition to the bean factory client methods in the BeanFactory interface. This bean factory interface is not meant to be used in normal application code: Stick to BeanFactory or ListableBeanFactory for typical needs. This extended interface is just meant to allow for framework-internal plug'n'play and for special access to bean factory configuration methods.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/ConfigurableBeanFactory.html
ConfigurableListableBeanFactory	A										<section class="prog__container">Configuration interface to be implemented by most listable bean factories. In addition to ConfigurableBeanFactory, it provides facilities to analyze and modify bean definitions, and to pre-instantiate singletons. This subinterface of BeanFactory is not meant to be used in normal application code: Stick to BeanFactory or ListableBeanFactory for typical use cases. This interface is just meant to allow for framework-internal plug'n'play even when needing access to bean factory configuration methods.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/ConfigurableListableBeanFactory.html
ConstructorArgumentValues	A										<section class="prog__container">Holder for constructor argument values, typically as part of a bean definition. Supports values for a specific index in the constructor argument list as well as for generic argument matches by type.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/ConstructorArgumentValues.html
ConstructorArgumentValues.ValueHolder	A										<section class="prog__container">Holder for a constructor argument value, with an optional type attribute indicating the target type of the actual constructor argument.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/ConstructorArgumentValues.ValueHolder.html
CustomEditorConfigurer	A										<section class="prog__container">BeanFactoryPostProcessor implementation that allows for convenient registration of custom property editors. In case you want to register PropertyEditor instances, the recommended usage as of Spring 2.0 is to use custom PropertyEditorRegistrar implementations that in turn register any desired editor instances on a given registry. Each PropertyEditorRegistrar can register any number of custom editors.  <bean id="customEditorConfigurer" class="org.springframework.beans.factory.config.CustomEditorConfigurer">   <property name="propertyEditorRegistrars">     <list>       <bean class="mypackage.MyCustomDateEditorRegistrar"/>       <bean class="mypackage.MyObjectEditorRegistrar"/>     </list>   </property> </bean>  It's perfectly fine to register PropertyEditor classes via the customEditors property. Spring will create fresh instances of them for each editing attempt then:  <bean id="customEditorConfigurer" class="org.springframework.beans.factory.config.CustomEditorConfigurer">   <property name="customEditors">     <map>       <entry key="java.util.Date" value="mypackage.MyCustomDateEditor"/>       <entry key="mypackage.MyObject" value="mypackage.MyObjectEditor"/>     </map>   </property> </bean>  Note, that you shouldn't register PropertyEditor bean instances via the customEditors property as PropertyEditors are stateful and the instances will then have to be synchronized for every editing attempt. In case you need control over the instantiation process of PropertyEditors, use a PropertyEditorRegistrar to register them.  Also supports "java.lang.String[]"-style array class names and primitive class names (e.g. "boolean"). Delegates to ClassUtils for actual class name resolution. NOTE: Custom property editors registered with this configurer do not apply to data binding. Custom editors for data binding need to be registered on the DataBinder: Use a common base class or delegate to common PropertyEditorRegistrar implementations to reuse editor registration there.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/CustomEditorConfigurer.html
CustomScopeConfigurer	A										<section class="prog__container">Simple BeanFactoryPostProcessor implementation that registers custom Scope(s) with the containing ConfigurableBeanFactory. Will register all of the supplied scopes with the ConfigurableListableBeanFactory that is passed to the postProcessBeanFactory(ConfigurableListableBeanFactory) method. This class allows for declarative registration of custom scopes. Alternatively, consider implementing a custom BeanFactoryPostProcessor that calls ConfigurableBeanFactory.registerScope(java.lang.String, org.springframework.beans.factory.config.Scope) programmatically.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/CustomScopeConfigurer.html
DependencyDescriptor	A										<section class="prog__container">Descriptor for a specific dependency that is about to be injected. Wraps a constructor parameter, a method parameter or a field, allowing unified access to their metadata.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/DependencyDescriptor.html
DeprecatedBeanWarner	A										<section class="prog__container">Bean factory post processor that logs a warning for @Deprecated beans.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/DeprecatedBeanWarner.html
DestructionAwareBeanPostProcessor	A										<section class="prog__container">Subinterface of BeanPostProcessor that adds a before-destruction callback. The typical usage will be to invoke custom destruction callbacks on specific bean types, matching corresponding initialization callbacks.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/DestructionAwareBeanPostProcessor.html
EmbeddedValueResolver	A										<section class="prog__container">StringValueResolver adapter for resolving placeholders and expressions against a ConfigurableBeanFactory. Note that this adapter resolves expressions as well, in contrast to the ConfigurableBeanFactory.resolveEmbeddedValue(java.lang.String) method. The BeanExpressionContext used is for the plain bean factory, with no scope specified for any contextual objects to access.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/EmbeddedValueResolver.html
FieldRetrievingFactoryBean	A										<section class="prog__container">FactoryBean which retrieves a static or non-static field value. Typically used for retrieving public static final constants. Usage example: // standard definition for exposing a static field, specifying the "staticField" property <bean id="myField" class="org.springframework.beans.factory.config.FieldRetrievingFactoryBean">   <property name="staticField" value="java.sql.Connection.TRANSACTION_SERIALIZABLE"/> </bean> // convenience version that specifies a static field pattern as bean name <bean id="java.sql.Connection.TRANSACTION_SERIALIZABLE"       class="org.springframework.beans.factory.config.FieldRetrievingFactoryBean"/></section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/FieldRetrievingFactoryBean.html
InstantiationAwareBeanPostProcessor	A										<section class="prog__container">Subinterface of BeanPostProcessor that adds a before-instantiation callback, and a callback after instantiation but before explicit properties are set or autowiring occurs. Typically used to suppress default instantiation for specific target beans, for example to create proxies with special TargetSources (pooling targets, lazily initializing targets, etc), or to implement additional injection strategies such as field injection. NOTE: This interface is a special purpose interface, mainly for internal use within the framework. It is recommended to implement the plain BeanPostProcessor interface as far as possible, or to derive from InstantiationAwareBeanPostProcessorAdapter in order to be shielded from extensions to this interface.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/InstantiationAwareBeanPostProcessor.html
InstantiationAwareBeanPostProcessorAdapter	A										<section class="prog__container">Adapter that implements all methods on SmartInstantiationAwareBeanPostProcessor as no-ops, which will not change normal processing of each bean instantiated by the container. Subclasses may override merely those methods that they are actually interested in. Note that this base class is only recommendable if you actually require InstantiationAwareBeanPostProcessor functionality. If all you need is plain BeanPostProcessor functionality, prefer a straight implementation of that (simpler) interface.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/InstantiationAwareBeanPostProcessorAdapter.html
ListFactoryBean	A										<section class="prog__container">Simple factory for shared List instances. Allows for central setup of Lists via the "list" element in XML bean definitions.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/ListFactoryBean.html
MapFactoryBean	A										<section class="prog__container">Simple factory for shared Map instances. Allows for central setup of Maps via the "map" element in XML bean definitions.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/MapFactoryBean.html
MethodInvokingBean	A										<section class="prog__container">Simple method invoker bean: just invoking a target method, not expecting a result to expose to the container (in contrast to MethodInvokingFactoryBean). This invoker supports any kind of target method. A static method may be specified by setting the targetMethod property to a String representing the static method name, with targetClass specifying the Class that the static method is defined on. Alternatively, a target instance method may be specified, by setting the targetObject property as the target object, and the targetMethod property as the name of the method to call on that target object. Arguments for the method invocation may be specified by setting the arguments property. This class depends on afterPropertiesSet() being called once all properties have been set, as per the InitializingBean contract. An example (in an XML based bean factory definition) of a bean definition which uses this class to call a static initialization method:  <bean id="myObject" class="org.springframework.beans.factory.config.MethodInvokingBean">   <property name="staticMethod" value="com.whatever.MyClass.init"/> </bean>An example of calling an instance method to start some server bean:  <bean id="myStarter" class="org.springframework.beans.factory.config.MethodInvokingBean">   <property name="targetObject" ref="myServer"/>   <property name="targetMethod" value="start"/> </bean></section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/MethodInvokingBean.html
MethodInvokingFactoryBean	A										<section class="prog__container">FactoryBean which returns a value which is the result of a static or instance method invocation. For most use cases it is better to just use the container's built-in factory method support for the same purpose, since that is smarter at converting arguments. This factory bean is still useful though when you need to call a method which doesn't return any value (for example, a static class method to force some sort of initialization to happen). This use case is not supported by factory methods, since a return value is needed to obtain the bean instance. Note that as it is expected to be used mostly for accessing factory methods, this factory by default operates in a singleton fashion. The first request to getObject() by the owning bean factory will cause a method invocation, whose return value will be cached for subsequent requests. An internal singleton property may be set to "false", to cause this factory to invoke the target method each time it is asked for an object. NOTE: If your target method does not produce a result to expose, consider MethodInvokingBean instead, which avoids the type determination and lifecycle limitations that this MethodInvokingFactoryBean comes with.This invoker supports any kind of target method. A static method may be specified by setting the targetMethod property to a String representing the static method name, with targetClass specifying the Class that the static method is defined on. Alternatively, a target instance method may be specified, by setting the targetObject property as the target object, and the targetMethod property as the name of the method to call on that target object. Arguments for the method invocation may be specified by setting the arguments property. This class depends on afterPropertiesSet() being called once all properties have been set, as per the InitializingBean contract. An example (in an XML based bean factory definition) of a bean definition which uses this class to call a static factory method:  <bean id="myObject" class="org.springframework.beans.factory.config.MethodInvokingFactoryBean">   <property name="staticMethod" value="com.whatever.MyClassFactory.getInstance"/> </bean>An example of calling a static method then an instance method to get at a Java system property. Somewhat verbose, but it works.  <bean id="sysProps" class="org.springframework.beans.factory.config.MethodInvokingFactoryBean">   <property name="targetClass" value="java.lang.System"/>   <property name="targetMethod" value="getProperties"/> </bean> <bean id="javaVersion" class="org.springframework.beans.factory.config.MethodInvokingFactoryBean">   <property name="targetObject" value="sysProps"/>   <property name="targetMethod" value="getProperty"/>   <property name="arguments" value="java.version"/> </bean></section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/MethodInvokingFactoryBean.html
NamedBeanHolder	A										<section class="prog__container">A simple holder for a given bean name plus bean instance.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/NamedBeanHolder.html
ObjectFactoryCreatingFactoryBean	A										<section class="prog__container">A FactoryBean implementation that returns a value which is an ObjectFactory that in turn returns a bean sourced from a BeanFactory. As such, this may be used to avoid having a client object directly calling BeanFactory.getBean(String) to get a (typically prototype) bean from a BeanFactory, which would be a violation of the inversion of control principle. Instead, with the use of this class, the client object can be fed an ObjectFactory instance as a property which directly returns only the one target bean (again, which is typically a prototype bean). A sample config in an XML-based BeanFactory might look as follows: <beans>   <!-- Prototype bean since we have state -->   <bean id="myService" class="a.b.c.MyService" scope="prototype"/>   <bean id="myServiceFactory"       class="org.springframework.beans.factory.config.ObjectFactoryCreatingFactoryBean">     <property name="targetBeanName"><idref local="myService"/></property>   </bean>   <bean id="clientBean" class="a.b.c.MyClientBean">     <property name="myServiceFactory" ref="myServiceFactory"/>   </bean></beans>The attendant MyClientBean class implementation might look something like this: package a.b.c; import org.springframework.beans.factory.ObjectFactory; public class MyClientBean {   private ObjectFactory<MyService> myServiceFactory;   public void setMyServiceFactory(ObjectFactory<MyService> myServiceFactory) {     this.myServiceFactory = myServiceFactory;   }   public void someBusinessMethod() {     // get a 'fresh', brand new MyService instance     MyService service = this.myServiceFactory.getObject();     // use the service object to effect the business logic...   } }An alternate approach to this application of an object creational pattern would be to use the ServiceLocatorFactoryBean to source (prototype) beans. The ServiceLocatorFactoryBean approach has the advantage of the fact that one doesn't have to depend on any Spring-specific interface such as ObjectFactory, but has the disadvantage of requiring runtime class generation. Please do consult the ServiceLocatorFactoryBean JavaDoc for a fuller discussion of this issue.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/ObjectFactoryCreatingFactoryBean.html
PlaceholderConfigurerSupport	A										<section class="prog__container">Abstract base class for property resource configurers that resolve placeholders in bean definition property values. Implementations pull values from a properties file or other property source into bean definitions. The default placeholder syntax follows the Ant / Log4J / JSP EL style: ${...} Example XML bean definition:         </section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/PlaceholderConfigurerSupport.html
PreferencesPlaceholderConfigurer	A										<section class="prog__container">Subclass of PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer that supports JDK 1.4's Preferences API (java.util.prefs). Tries to resolve placeholders as keys first in the user preferences, then in the system preferences, then in this configurer's properties. Thus, behaves like PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer if no corresponding preferences defined. Supports custom paths for the system and user preferences trees. Also supports custom paths specified in placeholders ("myPath/myPlaceholderKey"). Uses the respective root node if not specified.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/PreferencesPlaceholderConfigurer.html
PropertiesFactoryBean	A										<section class="prog__container">Allows for making a properties file from a classpath location available as Properties instance in a bean factory. Can be used to populate any bean property of type Properties via a bean reference. Supports loading from a properties file and/or setting local properties on this FactoryBean. The created Properties instance will be merged from loaded and local values. If neither a location nor local properties are set, an exception will be thrown on initialization. Can create a singleton or a new object on each request. Default is a singleton.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/PropertiesFactoryBean.html
PropertyOverrideConfigurer	A										<section class="prog__container">Property resource configurer that overrides bean property values in an application context definition. It pushes values from a properties file into bean definitions. Configuration lines are expected to be of the following form: beanName.property=value Example properties file: dataSource.driverClassName=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver dataSource.url=jdbc:mysql:mydb In contrast to PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer, the original definition can have default values or no values at all for such bean properties. If an overriding properties file does not have an entry for a certain bean property, the default context definition is used. Note that the context definition is not aware of being overridden; so this is not immediately obvious when looking at the XML definition file. Furthermore, note that specified override values are always literal values; they are not translated into bean references. This also applies when the original value in the XML bean definition specifies a bean reference. In case of multiple PropertyOverrideConfigurers that define different values for the same bean property, the last one will win (due to the overriding mechanism). Property values can be converted after reading them in, through overriding the convertPropertyValue method. For example, encrypted values can be detected and decrypted accordingly before processing them.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/PropertyOverrideConfigurer.html
PropertyPathFactoryBean	A										<section class="prog__container">FactoryBean that evaluates a property path on a given target object. The target object can be specified directly or via a bean name. Usage examples: <!-- target bean to be referenced by name --> <bean id="tb" class="org.springframework.beans.TestBean" singleton="false">   <property name="age" value="10"/>   <property name="spouse">     <bean class="org.springframework.beans.TestBean">       <property name="age" value="11"/>     </bean>   </property> </bean> <!-- will result in 12, which is the value of property 'age' of the inner bean --> <bean id="propertyPath1" class="org.springframework.beans.factory.config.PropertyPathFactoryBean">   <property name="targetObject">     <bean class="org.springframework.beans.TestBean">       <property name="age" value="12"/>     </bean>   </property>   <property name="propertyPath" value="age"/> </bean> <!-- will result in 11, which is the value of property 'spouse.age' of bean 'tb' --> <bean id="propertyPath2" class="org.springframework.beans.factory.config.PropertyPathFactoryBean">   <property name="targetBeanName" value="tb"/>   <property name="propertyPath" value="spouse.age"/> </bean> <!-- will result in 10, which is the value of property 'age' of bean 'tb' --> <bean id="tb.age" class="org.springframework.beans.factory.config.PropertyPathFactoryBean"/>If you are using Spring 2.0 and XML Schema support in your configuration file(s), you can also use the following style of configuration for property path access. (See also the appendix entitled 'XML Schema-based configuration' in the Spring reference manual for more examples.)  <!-- will result in 10, which is the value of property 'age' of bean 'tb' --> <util:property-path id="name" path="testBean.age"/> Thanks to Matthias Ernst for the suggestion and initial prototype!</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/PropertyPathFactoryBean.html
PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer	A										<section class="prog__container">PlaceholderConfigurerSupport subclass that resolves ${...} placeholders against local properties and/or system properties and environment variables. As of Spring 3.1, PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer should be used preferentially over this implementation; it is more flexible through taking advantage of the Environment and PropertySource mechanisms also made available in Spring 3.1. PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer is still appropriate for use when: the spring-context module is not available (i.e., one is using Spring's BeanFactory API as opposed to ApplicationContext). existing configuration makes use of the "systemPropertiesMode" and/or "systemPropertiesModeName" properties. Users are encouraged to move away from using these settings, and rather configure property source search order through the container's Environment; however, exact preservation of functionality may be maintained by continuing to use PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer. Prior to Spring 3.1, the <context:property-placeholder/> namespace element registered an instance of PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer. It will still do so if using the spring-context-3.0.xsd definition of the namespace. That is, you can preserve registration of PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer through the namespace, even if using Spring 3.1; simply do not update your xsi:schemaLocation and continue using the 3.0 XSD.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer.html
PropertyResourceConfigurer	A										<section class="prog__container">Allows for configuration of individual bean property values from a property resource, i.e. a properties file. Useful for custom config files targeted at system administrators that override bean properties configured in the application context. Two concrete implementations are provided in the distribution: PropertyOverrideConfigurer for "beanName.property=value" style overriding (pushing values from a properties file into bean definitions) PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer for replacing "${...}" placeholders (pulling values from a properties file into bean definitions) Property values can be converted after reading them in, through overriding the convertPropertyValue(java.lang.String) method. For example, encrypted values can be detected and decrypted accordingly before processing them.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/PropertyResourceConfigurer.html
ProviderCreatingFactoryBean	A										<section class="prog__container">A FactoryBean implementation that returns a value which is a JSR-330 Provider that in turn returns a bean sourced from a BeanFactory. This is basically a JSR-330 compliant variant of Spring's good old ObjectFactoryCreatingFactoryBean. It can be used for traditional external dependency injection configuration that targets a property or constructor argument of type javax.inject.Provider, as an alternative to JSR-330's @Inject annotation-driven approach.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/ProviderCreatingFactoryBean.html
RuntimeBeanNameReference	A										<section class="prog__container">Immutable placeholder class used for a property value object when it's a reference to another bean name in the factory, to be resolved at runtime.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/RuntimeBeanNameReference.html
RuntimeBeanReference	A										<section class="prog__container">Immutable placeholder class used for a property value object when it's a reference to another bean in the factory, to be resolved at runtime.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/RuntimeBeanReference.html
Scope	A										<section class="prog__container">Strategy interface used by a ConfigurableBeanFactory, representing a target scope to hold bean instances in. This allows for extending the BeanFactory's standard scopes "singleton" and "prototype" with custom further scopes, registered for a specific key. ApplicationContext implementations such as a WebApplicationContext may register additional standard scopes specific to their environment, e.g. "request" and "session", based on this Scope SPI. Even if its primary use is for extended scopes in a web environment, this SPI is completely generic: It provides the ability to get and put objects from any underlying storage mechanism, such as an HTTP session or a custom conversation mechanism. The name passed into this class's get and remove methods will identify the target object in the current scope. Scope implementations are expected to be thread-safe. One Scope instance can be used with multiple bean factories at the same time, if desired (unless it explicitly wants to be aware of the containing BeanFactory), with any number of threads accessing the Scope concurrently from any number of factories.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/Scope.html
ServiceLocatorFactoryBean	A										<section class="prog__container">A FactoryBean implementation that takes an interface which must have one or more methods with the signatures MyType xxx() or MyType xxx(MyIdType id) (typically, MyService getService() or MyService getService(String id)) and creates a dynamic proxy which implements that interface, delegating to an underlying BeanFactory. Such service locators permit the decoupling of calling code from the BeanFactory API, by using an appropriate custom locator interface. They will typically be used for prototype beans, i.e. for factory methods that are supposed to return a new instance for each call. The client receives a reference to the service locator via setter or constructor injection, to be able to invoke the locator's factory methods on demand. For singleton beans, direct setter or constructor injection of the target bean is preferable.On invocation of the no-arg factory method, or the single-arg factory method with a String id of null or empty String, if exactly one bean in the factory matches the return type of the factory method, that bean is returned, otherwise a NoSuchBeanDefinitionException is thrown. On invocation of the single-arg factory method with a non-null (and non-empty) argument, the proxy returns the result of a BeanFactory.getBean(String) call, using a stringified version of the passed-in id as bean name. A factory method argument will usually be a String, but can also be an int or a custom enumeration type, for example, stringified via toString. The resulting String can be used as bean name as-is, provided that corresponding beans are defined in the bean factory. Alternatively, a custom mapping between service IDs and bean names can be defined. By way of an example, consider the following service locator interface. Note that this interface is not dependent on any Spring APIs. package a.b.c;public interface ServiceFactory {    public MyService getService();}A sample config in an XML-based BeanFactory might look as follows: <beans>   <!-- Prototype bean since we have state -->   <bean id="myService" class="a.b.c.MyService" singleton="false"/>   <!-- will lookup the above 'myService' bean by *TYPE* -->   <bean id="myServiceFactory"            class="org.springframework.beans.factory.config.ServiceLocatorFactoryBean">     <property name="serviceLocatorInterface" value="a.b.c.ServiceFactory"/>   </bean>   <bean id="clientBean" class="a.b.c.MyClientBean">     <property name="myServiceFactory" ref="myServiceFactory"/>   </bean></beans>The attendant MyClientBean class implementation might then look something like this: package a.b.c;public class MyClientBean {    private ServiceFactory myServiceFactory;    // actual implementation provided by the Spring container    public void setServiceFactory(ServiceFactory myServiceFactory) {        this.myServiceFactory = myServiceFactory;    }    public void someBusinessMethod() {        // get a 'fresh', brand new MyService instance        MyService service = this.myServiceFactory.getService();        // use the service object to effect the business logic...    }}By way of an example that looks up a bean by name, consider the following service locator interface. Again, note that this interface is not dependent on any Spring APIs. package a.b.c;public interface ServiceFactory {    public MyService getService (String serviceName);}A sample config in an XML-based BeanFactory might look as follows: <beans>   <!-- Prototype beans since we have state (both extend MyService) -->   <bean id="specialService" class="a.b.c.SpecialService" singleton="false"/>   <bean id="anotherService" class="a.b.c.AnotherService" singleton="false"/>   <bean id="myServiceFactory"            class="org.springframework.beans.factory.config.ServiceLocatorFactoryBean">     <property name="serviceLocatorInterface" value="a.b.c.ServiceFactory"/>   </bean>   <bean id="clientBean" class="a.b.c.MyClientBean">     <property name="myServiceFactory" ref="myServiceFactory"/>   </bean></beans>The attendant MyClientBean class implementation might then look something like this: package a.b.c;public class MyClientBean {    private ServiceFactory myServiceFactory;    // actual implementation provided by the Spring container    public void setServiceFactory(ServiceFactory myServiceFactory) {        this.myServiceFactory = myServiceFactory;    }    public void someBusinessMethod() {        // get a 'fresh', brand new MyService instance        MyService service = this.myServiceFactory.getService("specialService");        // use the service object to effect the business logic...    }    public void anotherBusinessMethod() {        // get a 'fresh', brand new MyService instance        MyService service = this.myServiceFactory.getService("anotherService");        // use the service object to effect the business logic...    }}See ObjectFactoryCreatingFactoryBean for an alternate approach.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/ServiceLocatorFactoryBean.html
SetFactoryBean	A										<section class="prog__container">Simple factory for shared Set instances. Allows for central setup of Sets via the "set" element in XML bean definitions.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/SetFactoryBean.html
SingletonBeanRegistry	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface that defines a registry for shared bean instances. Can be implemented by BeanFactory implementations in order to expose their singleton management facility in a uniform manner. The ConfigurableBeanFactory interface extends this interface.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/SingletonBeanRegistry.html
SmartInstantiationAwareBeanPostProcessor	A										<section class="prog__container">Extension of the InstantiationAwareBeanPostProcessor interface, adding a callback for predicting the eventual type of a processed bean. NOTE: This interface is a special purpose interface, mainly for internal use within the framework. In general, application-provided post-processors should simply implement the plain BeanPostProcessor interface or derive from the InstantiationAwareBeanPostProcessorAdapter class. New methods might be added to this interface even in point releases.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/SmartInstantiationAwareBeanPostProcessor.html
TypedStringValue	A										<section class="prog__container">Holder for a typed String value. Can be added to bean definitions in order to explicitly specify a target type for a String value, for example for collection elements. This holder will just store the String value and the target type. The actual conversion will be performed by the bean factory.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/TypedStringValue.html
YamlMapFactoryBean	A										<section class="prog__container">Factory for a Map that reads from a YAML source, preserving the YAML-declared value types and their structure. YAML is a nice human-readable format for configuration, and it has some useful hierarchical properties. It's more or less a superset of JSON, so it has a lot of similar features. If multiple resources are provided the later ones will override entries in the earlier ones hierarchically; that is, all entries with the same nested key of type Map at any depth are merged. For example:  foo:   bar:    one: two three: four  plus (later in the list)  foo:   bar:    one: 2 five: six  results in an effective input of  foo:   bar:    one: 2 three: four five: six  Note that the value of "foo" in the first document is not simply replaced with the value in the second, but its nested values are merged.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/YamlMapFactoryBean.html

YamlPropertiesFactoryBean	A										<section class="prog__container">Factory for Properties that reads from a YAML source, exposing a flat structure of String property values. YAML is a nice human-readable format for configuration, and it has some useful hierarchical properties. It's more or less a superset of JSON, so it has a lot of similar features. Note: All exposed values are of type String for access through the common Properties.getProperty(java.lang.String) method (e.g. in configuration property resolution through PropertiesLoaderSupport.setProperties(Properties)). If this is not desirable, use YamlMapFactoryBean instead. The Properties created by this factory have nested paths for hierarchical objects, so for instance this YAML  environments:   dev:     url: http://dev.bar.com     name: Developer Setup   prod:     url: http://foo.bar.com     name: My Cool App  is transformed into these properties:  environments.dev.url=http://dev.bar.com environments.dev.name=Developer Setup environments.prod.url=http://foo.bar.com environments.prod.name=My Cool App  Lists are split as property keys with [] dereferencers, for example this YAML:  servers: - dev.bar.com - foo.bar.com  becomes properties like this:  servers[0]=dev.bar.com servers[1]=foo.bar.com </section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/YamlPropertiesFactoryBean.html
GroovyBeanDefinitionReader	A										<section class="prog__container">A Groovy-based reader for Spring bean definitions: like a Groovy builder, but more of a DSL for Spring configuration. This bean definition reader also understands XML bean definition files, allowing for seamless mixing and matching with Groovy bean definition files. Typically applied to a DefaultListableBeanFactory or a GenericApplicationContext, but can be used against any BeanDefinitionRegistry implementation. Example Syntax import org.hibernate.SessionFactory import org.apache.commons.dbcp.BasicDataSource def reader = new GroovyBeanDefinitionReader(myApplicationContext) reader.beans {     dataSource(BasicDataSource) {                  // <--- invokeMethod         driverClassName = "org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver"         url = "jdbc:hsqldb:mem:grailsDB"         username = "sa"                            // <-- setProperty         password = ""         settings = [mynew:"setting"]     }     sessionFactory(SessionFactory) {         dataSource = dataSource                    // <-- getProperty for retrieving references     }     myService(MyService) {         nestedBean = { AnotherBean bean ->         // <-- setProperty with closure for nested bean             dataSource = dataSource         }     } }You can also load resources containing beans defined in a Groovy script using either the AbstractBeanDefinitionReader.loadBeanDefinitions(Resource...) or AbstractBeanDefinitionReader.loadBeanDefinitions(String...) method, with a script looking similar to the following.  import org.hibernate.SessionFactory import org.apache.commons.dbcp.BasicDataSource beans {     dataSource(BasicDataSource) {         driverClassName = "org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver"         url = "jdbc:hsqldb:mem:grailsDB"         username = "sa"         password = ""         settings = [mynew:"setting"]     }     sessionFactory(SessionFactory) {         dataSource = dataSource     }     myService(MyService) {         nestedBean = { AnotherBean bean ->             dataSource = dataSource         }     } }</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/groovy/GroovyBeanDefinitionReader.html

BeanEntry	A										<section class="prog__container">ParseState entry representing a bean definition.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/parsing/BeanEntry.html
ComponentDefinition	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface that describes the logical view of a set of BeanDefinitions and BeanReferences as presented in some configuration context. With the introduction of pluggable custom XML tags, it is now possible for a single logical configuration entity, in this case an XML tag, to create multiple BeanDefinitions and RuntimeBeanReferences in order to provide more succinct configuration and greater convenience to end users. As such, it can no longer be assumed that each configuration entity (e.g. XML tag) maps to one BeanDefinition. For tool vendors and other users who wish to present visualization or support for configuring Spring applications it is important that there is some mechanism in place to tie the BeanDefinitions in the BeanFactory back to the configuration data in a way that has concrete meaning to the end user. As such, NamespaceHandler implementations are able to publish events in the form of a ComponentDefinition for each logical entity being configured. Third parties can then subscribe to these events, allowing for a user-centric view of the bean metadata. Each ComponentDefinition has a source object which is configuration-specific. In the case of XML-based configuration this is typically the Node which contains the user supplied configuration information. In addition to this, each BeanDefinition enclosed in a ComponentDefinition has its own source object which may point to a different, more specific, set of configuration data. Beyond this, individual pieces of bean metadata such as the PropertyValues may also have a source object giving an even greater level of detail. Source object extraction is handled through the SourceExtractor which can be customized as required. Whilst direct access to important BeanReferences is provided through getBeanReferences(), tools may wish to inspect all BeanDefinitions to gather the full set of BeanReferences. Implementations are required to provide all BeanReferences that are required to validate the configuration of the overall logical entity as well as those required to provide full user visualisation of the configuration. It is expected that certain BeanReferences will not be important to validation or to the user view of the configuration and as such these may be ommitted. A tool may wish to display any additional BeanReferences sourced through the supplied BeanDefinitions but this is not considered to be a typical case. Tools can determine the important of contained BeanDefinitions by checking the role identifier. The role is essentially a hint to the tool as to how important the configuration provider believes a BeanDefinition is to the end user. It is expected that tools will not display all BeanDefinitions for a given ComponentDefinition choosing instead to filter based on the role. Tools may choose to make this filtering user configurable. Particular notice should be given to the INFRASTRUCTURE role identifier. BeanDefinitions classified with this role are completely unimportant to the end user and are required only for internal implementation reasons.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/parsing/ComponentDefinition.html

Location	A										<section class="prog__container">Class that models an arbitrary location in a resource. Typically used to track the location of problematic or erroneous metadata in XML configuration files. For example, a source location might be 'The bean defined on line 76 of beans.properties has an invalid Class'; another source might be the actual DOM Element from a parsed XML Document; or the source object might simply be null.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/parsing/Location.html
NullSourceExtractor	A										<section class="prog__container">Simple implementation of SourceExtractor that returns null as the source metadata.

This representation is intended for use in error messages.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/parsing/ParseState.html
PassThroughSourceExtractor	A										<section class="prog__container">Simple SourceExtractor implementation that just passes the candidate source metadata object through for attachment. Using this implementation means that tools will get raw access to the underlying configuration source metadata provided by the tool. This implementation should not be used in a production application since it is likely to keep too much metadata in memory (unnecessarily).</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/parsing/PassThroughSourceExtractor.html

AbstractAutowireCapableBeanFactory	A										<section class="prog__container">Abstract bean factory superclass that implements default bean creation, with the full capabilities specified by the RootBeanDefinition class. Implements the AutowireCapableBeanFactory interface in addition to AbstractBeanFactory's createBean(java.lang.Class<T>) method. Provides bean creation (with constructor resolution), property population, wiring (including autowiring), and initialization. Handles runtime bean references, resolves managed collections, calls initialization methods, etc. Supports autowiring constructors, properties by name, and properties by type. The main template method to be implemented by subclasses is AutowireCapableBeanFactory.resolveDependency(DependencyDescriptor, String, Set, TypeConverter), used for autowiring by type. In case of a factory which is capable of searching its bean definitions, matching beans will typically be implemented through such a search. For other factory styles, simplified matching algorithms can be implemented. Note that this class does not assume or implement bean definition registry capabilities. See DefaultListableBeanFactory for an implementation of the ListableBeanFactory and BeanDefinitionRegistry interfaces, which represent the API and SPI view of such a factory, respectively.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/support/AbstractAutowireCapableBeanFactory.html

AbstractBeanFactory	A										<section class="prog__container">Abstract base class for BeanFactory implementations, providing the full capabilities of the ConfigurableBeanFactory SPI. Does not assume a listable bean factory: can therefore also be used as base class for bean factory implementations which obtain bean definitions from some backend resource (where bean definition access is an expensive operation). This class provides a singleton cache (through its base class DefaultSingletonBeanRegistry, singleton/prototype determination, FactoryBean handling, aliases, bean definition merging for child bean definitions, and bean destruction (DisposableBean interface, custom destroy methods). Furthermore, it can manage a bean factory hierarchy (delegating to the parent in case of an unknown bean), through implementing the HierarchicalBeanFactory interface. The main template methods to be implemented by subclasses are getBeanDefinition(java.lang.String) and createBean(java.lang.String, org.springframework.beans.factory.support.RootBeanDefinition, java.lang.Object[]), retrieving a bean definition for a given bean name and creating a bean instance for a given bean definition, respectively. Default implementations of those operations can be found in DefaultListableBeanFactory and AbstractAutowireCapableBeanFactory.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/support/AbstractBeanFactory.html

BeanDefinitionReader	A										<section class="prog__container">Simple interface for bean definition readers. Specifies load methods with Resource and String location parameters. Concrete bean definition readers can of course add additional load and register methods for bean definitions, specific to their bean definition format. Note that a bean definition reader does not have to implement this interface.

BeanDefinitionRegistry	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface for registries that hold bean definitions, for example RootBeanDefinition and ChildBeanDefinition instances. Typically implemented by BeanFactories that internally work with the AbstractBeanDefinition hierarchy. This is the only interface in Spring's bean factory packages that encapsulates registration of bean definitions. The standard BeanFactory interfaces only cover access to a fully configured factory instance. Spring's bean definition readers expect to work on an implementation of this interface. Known implementors within the Spring core are DefaultListableBeanFactory and GenericApplicationContext.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/support/BeanDefinitionRegistry.html
BeanDefinitionRegistryPostProcessor	A										<section class="prog__container">Extension to the standard BeanFactoryPostProcessor SPI, allowing for the registration of further bean definitions before regular BeanFactoryPostProcessor detection kicks in. In particular, BeanDefinitionRegistryPostProcessor may register further bean definitions which in turn define BeanFactoryPostProcessor instances.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/support/BeanDefinitionRegistryPostProcessor.html

ChildBeanDefinition	A										<section class="prog__container">Bean definition for beans which inherit settings from their parent. Child bean definitions have a fixed dependency on a parent bean definition. A child bean definition will inherit constructor argument values, property values and method overrides from the parent, with the option to add new values. If init method, destroy method and/or static factory method are specified, they will override the corresponding parent settings. The remaining settings will always be taken from the child definition: depends on, autowire mode, dependency check, singleton, lazy init. NOTE: Since Spring 2.5, the preferred way to register bean definitions programmatically is the GenericBeanDefinition class, which allows to dynamically define parent dependencies through the GenericBeanDefinition.setParentName(java.lang.String) method. This effectively supersedes the ChildBeanDefinition class for most use cases.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/support/ChildBeanDefinition.html
DefaultBeanNameGenerator	A										<section class="prog__container">Default implementation of the BeanNameGenerator interface, delegating to BeanDefinitionReaderUtils.generateBeanName(BeanDefinition, BeanDefinitionRegistry).</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/support/DefaultBeanNameGenerator.html
DefaultListableBeanFactory	A										<section class="prog__container">Default implementation of the ListableBeanFactory and BeanDefinitionRegistry interfaces: a full-fledged bean factory based on bean definition objects. Typical usage is registering all bean definitions first (possibly read from a bean definition file), before accessing beans. Bean definition lookup is therefore an inexpensive operation in a local bean definition table, operating on pre-built bean definition metadata objects. Can be used as a standalone bean factory, or as a superclass for custom bean factories. Note that readers for specific bean definition formats are typically implemented separately rather than as bean factory subclasses: see for example PropertiesBeanDefinitionReader and XmlBeanDefinitionReader. For an alternative implementation of the ListableBeanFactory interface, have a look at StaticListableBeanFactory, which manages existing bean instances rather than creating new ones based on bean definitions.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/support/DefaultListableBeanFactory.html
DefaultSingletonBeanRegistry	A										<section class="prog__container">Generic registry for shared bean instances, implementing the SingletonBeanRegistry. Allows for registering singleton instances that should be shared for all callers of the registry, to be obtained via bean name. Also supports registration of DisposableBean instances, (which might or might not correspond to registered singletons), to be destroyed on shutdown of the registry. Dependencies between beans can be registered to enforce an appropriate shutdown order. This class mainly serves as base class for BeanFactory implementations, factoring out the common management of singleton bean instances. Note that the ConfigurableBeanFactory interface extends the SingletonBeanRegistry interface. Note that this class assumes neither a bean definition concept nor a specific creation process for bean instances, in contrast to AbstractBeanFactory and DefaultListableBeanFactory (which inherit from it). Can alternatively also be used as a nested helper to delegate to.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/support/DefaultSingletonBeanRegistry.html
FactoryBeanRegistrySupport	A										<section class="prog__container">Support base class for singleton registries which need to handle FactoryBean instances, integrated with DefaultSingletonBeanRegistry's singleton management. Serves as base class for AbstractBeanFactory.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/support/FactoryBeanRegistrySupport.html
GenericBeanDefinition	A										<section class="prog__container">GenericBeanDefinition is a one-stop shop for standard bean definition purposes. Like any bean definition, it allows for specifying a class plus optionally constructor argument values and property values. Additionally, deriving from a parent bean definition can be flexibly configured through the "parentName" property. In general, use this GenericBeanDefinition class for the purpose of registering user-visible bean definitions (which a post-processor might operate on, potentially even reconfiguring the parent name). Use RootBeanDefinition / ChildBeanDefinition where parent/child relationships happen to be pre-determined.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/support/GenericBeanDefinition.html
GenericTypeAwareAutowireCandidateResolver	A										<section class="prog__container">Basic AutowireCandidateResolver that performs a full generic type match with the candidate's type if the dependency is declared as a generic type (e.g. Repository<Customer>). This is the base class for QualifierAnnotationAutowireCandidateResolver, providing an implementation all non-annotation-based resolution steps at this level.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/support/GenericTypeAwareAutowireCandidateResolver.html
InstantiationStrategy	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface responsible for creating instances corresponding to a root bean definition. This is pulled out into a strategy as various approaches are possible, including using CGLIB to create subclasses on the fly to support Method Injection.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/support/InstantiationStrategy.html
LookupOverride	A										<section class="prog__container">Represents an override of a method that looks up an object in the same IoC context. Methods eligible for lookup override must not have arguments.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/support/LookupOverride.html
ManagedArray	A										<section class="prog__container">Tag collection class used to hold managed array elements, which may include runtime bean references (to be resolved into bean objects).</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/support/ManagedArray.html
ManagedList	A										<section class="prog__container">Tag collection class used to hold managed List elements, which may include runtime bean references (to be resolved into bean objects).</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/support/ManagedList.html
ManagedMap	A										<section class="prog__container">Tag collection class used to hold managed Map values, which may include runtime bean references (to be resolved into bean objects).</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/support/ManagedMap.html
ManagedProperties	A										<section class="prog__container">Tag class which represents a Spring-managed Properties instance that supports merging of parent/child definitions.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/support/ManagedProperties.html
ManagedSet	A										<section class="prog__container">Tag collection class used to hold managed Set values, which may include runtime bean references (to be resolved into bean objects).</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/support/ManagedSet.html
MergedBeanDefinitionPostProcessor	A										<section class="prog__container">Post-processor callback interface for merged bean definitions at runtime. BeanPostProcessor implementations may implement this sub-interface in order to post-process the merged bean definition that the Spring BeanFactory uses to create a specific bean instance. The postProcessMergedBeanDefinition(org.springframework.beans.factory.support.RootBeanDefinition, java.lang.Class<?>, java.lang.String) method may for example introspect the bean definition in order to prepare some cached metadata before post-processing actual instances of a bean. It is also allowed to modify the bean definition but only for bean definition properties which are actually intended for concurrent modification. Basically, this only applies to operations defined on the RootBeanDefinition itself but not to the properties of its base classes.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/support/MergedBeanDefinitionPostProcessor.html
MethodOverride	A										<section class="prog__container">Object representing the override of a method on a managed object by the IoC container. Note that the override mechanism is not intended as a generic means of inserting crosscutting code: use AOP for that.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/support/MethodOverride.html
MethodOverrides	A										<section class="prog__container">Set of method overrides, determining which, if any, methods on a managed object the Spring IoC container will override at runtime. The currently supported MethodOverride variants are LookupOverride and ReplaceOverride.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/support/MethodOverrides.html
MethodReplacer	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface to be implemented by classes that can reimplement any method on an IoC-managed object: the Method Injection form of Dependency Injection. Such methods may be (but need not be) abstract, in which case the container will create a concrete subclass to instantiate.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/support/MethodReplacer.html
PropertiesBeanDefinitionReader	A										<section class="prog__container">Bean definition reader for a simple properties format. Provides bean definition registration methods for Map/Properties and ResourceBundle. Typically applied to a DefaultListableBeanFactory. Example: employee.(class)=MyClass       // bean is of class MyClass employee.(abstract)=true       // this bean can't be instantiated directly employee.group=Insurance       // real property employee.usesDialUp=false      // real property (potentially overridden) salesrep.(parent)=employee     // derives from "employee" bean definition salesrep.(lazy-init)=true      // lazily initialize this singleton bean salesrep.manager(ref)=tony     // reference to another bean salesrep.department=Sales      // real property techie.(parent)=employee       // derives from "employee" bean definition techie.(scope)=prototype       // bean is a prototype (not a shared instance) techie.manager(ref)=jeff       // reference to another bean techie.department=Engineering  // real property techie.usesDialUp=true         // real property (overriding parent value) ceo.$0(ref)=secretary          // inject 'secretary' bean as 0th constructor arg ceo.$1=1000000                 // inject value '1000000' at 1st constructor arg </section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/support/PropertiesBeanDefinitionReader.html
ReplaceOverride	A										<section class="prog__container">Extension of MethodOverride that represents an arbitrary override of a method by the IoC container. Any non-final method can be overridden, irrespective of its parameters and return types.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/support/ReplaceOverride.html
RootBeanDefinition	A										<section class="prog__container">A root bean definition represents the merged bean definition that backs a specific bean in a Spring BeanFactory at runtime. It might have been created from multiple original bean definitions that inherit from each other, typically registered as GenericBeanDefinitions. A root bean definition is essentially the 'unified' bean definition view at runtime. Root bean definitions may also be used for registering individual bean definitions in the configuration phase. However, since Spring 2.5, the preferred way to register bean definitions programmatically is the GenericBeanDefinition class. GenericBeanDefinition has the advantage that it allows to dynamically define parent dependencies, not 'hard-coding' the role as a root bean definition.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/support/RootBeanDefinition.html
SecurityContextProvider	A										<section class="prog__container">Provider of the security context of the code running inside the bean factory.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/support/SecurityContextProvider.html
SimpleAutowireCandidateResolver	A										<section class="prog__container">AutowireCandidateResolver implementation to use when no annotation support is available. This implementation checks the bean definition only.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/support/SimpleAutowireCandidateResolver.html
SimpleBeanDefinitionRegistry	A										<section class="prog__container">Simple implementation of the BeanDefinitionRegistry interface. Provides registry capabilities only, with no factory capabilities built in. Can for example be used for testing bean definition readers.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/support/SimpleBeanDefinitionRegistry.html
SimpleInstantiationStrategy	A										<section class="prog__container">Simple object instantiation strategy for use in a BeanFactory. Does not support Method Injection, although it provides hooks for subclasses to override to add Method Injection support, for example by overriding methods.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/support/SimpleInstantiationStrategy.html
SimpleSecurityContextProvider	A										<section class="prog__container">Simple SecurityContextProvider implementation.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/support/SimpleSecurityContextProvider.html
StaticListableBeanFactory	A										<section class="prog__container">Static BeanFactory implementation which allows to register existing singleton instances programmatically. Does not have support for prototype beans or aliases. Serves as example for a simple implementation of the ListableBeanFactory interface, managing existing bean instances rather than creating new ones based on bean definitions, and not implementing any extended SPI interfaces (such as ConfigurableBeanFactory). For a full-fledged factory based on bean definitions, have a look at DefaultListableBeanFactory.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/support/StaticListableBeanFactory.html
BeanConfigurerSupport	A										<section class="prog__container">Convenient base class for bean configurers that can perform Dependency Injection on objects (however they may be created). Typically subclassed by AspectJ aspects. Subclasses may also need a custom metadata resolution strategy, in the BeanWiringInfoResolver interface. The default implementation looks for a bean with the same name as the fully-qualified class name. (This is the default name of the bean in a Spring XML file if the 'id' attribute is not used.)</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/wiring/BeanConfigurerSupport.html
BeanWiringInfo	A										<section class="prog__container">Holder for bean wiring metadata information about a particular class. Used in conjunction with the Configurable annotation and the AspectJ AnnotationBeanConfigurerAspect.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/wiring/BeanWiringInfo.html
BeanWiringInfoResolver	A										<section class="prog__container">Strategy interface to be implemented by objects than can resolve bean name information, given a newly instantiated bean object. Invocations to the resolveWiringInfo(java.lang.Object) method on this interface will be driven by the AspectJ pointcut in the relevant concrete aspect. Metadata resolution strategy can be pluggable. A good default is ClassNameBeanWiringInfoResolver, which uses the fully-qualified class name as bean name.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/wiring/BeanWiringInfoResolver.html
ClassNameBeanWiringInfoResolver	A										<section class="prog__container">Simple default implementation of the BeanWiringInfoResolver interface, looking for a bean with the same name as the fully-qualified class name. This matches the default name of the bean in a Spring XML file if the bean tag's "id" attribute is not used.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/wiring/ClassNameBeanWiringInfoResolver.html
AbstractBeanDefinitionParser	A										<section class="prog__container">Abstract BeanDefinitionParser implementation providing a number of convenience methods and a template method that subclasses must override to provide the actual parsing logic. Use this BeanDefinitionParser implementation when you want to parse some arbitrarily complex XML into one or more BeanDefinitions. If you just want to parse some XML into a single BeanDefinition, you may wish to consider the simpler convenience extensions of this class, namely AbstractSingleBeanDefinitionParser and AbstractSimpleBeanDefinitionParser.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/xml/AbstractBeanDefinitionParser.html
AbstractSimpleBeanDefinitionParser	A										<section class="prog__container">Convenient base class for when there exists a one-to-one mapping between attribute names on the element that is to be parsed and the property names on the Class being configured. Extend this parser class when you want to create a single bean definition from a relatively simple custom XML element. The resulting BeanDefinition will be automatically registered with the relevant BeanDefinitionRegistry. An example will hopefully make the use of this particular parser class immediately clear. Consider the following class definition: public class SimpleCache implements Cache {     public void setName(String name) {...}     public void setTimeout(int timeout) {...}     public void setEvictionPolicy(EvictionPolicy policy) {...}     // remaining class definition elided for clarity... }Then let us assume the following XML tag has been defined to permit the easy configuration of instances of the above class; <caching:cache name="..." timeout="..." eviction-policy="..."/>All that is required of the Java developer tasked with writing the parser to parse the above XML tag into an actual SimpleCache bean definition is the following: public class SimpleCacheBeanDefinitionParser extends AbstractSimpleBeanDefinitionParser {     protected Class getBeanClass(Element element) {         return SimpleCache.class;     } }Please note that the AbstractSimpleBeanDefinitionParser is limited to populating the created bean definition with property values. if you want to parse constructor arguments and nested elements from the supplied XML element, then you will have to implement the postProcess(org.springframework.beans.factory.support.BeanDefinitionBuilder, org.w3c.dom.Element) method and do such parsing yourself, or (more likely) subclass the AbstractSingleBeanDefinitionParser or AbstractBeanDefinitionParser classes directly. The process of actually registering the SimpleCacheBeanDefinitionParser with the Spring XML parsing infrastructure is described in the Spring Framework reference documentation (in one of the appendices). For an example of this parser in action (so to speak), do look at the source code for the UtilNamespaceHandler.PropertiesBeanDefinitionParser; the observant (and even not so observant) reader will immediately notice that there is next to no code in the implementation. The PropertiesBeanDefinitionParser populates a PropertiesFactoryBean from an XML element that looks like this: <util:properties location="jdbc.properties"/>The observant reader will notice that the sole attribute on the <util:properties/> element matches the PropertiesLoaderSupport.setLocation(org.springframework.core.io.Resource) method name on the PropertiesFactoryBean (the general usage thus illustrated holds true for any number of attributes). All that the PropertiesBeanDefinitionParser needs actually do is supply an implementation of the AbstractSingleBeanDefinitionParser.getBeanClass(org.w3c.dom.Element) method to return the PropertiesFactoryBean type.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/xml/AbstractSimpleBeanDefinitionParser.html
AbstractSingleBeanDefinitionParser	A										<section class="prog__container">Base class for those BeanDefinitionParser implementations that need to parse and define just a single BeanDefinition. Extend this parser class when you want to create a single bean definition from an arbitrarily complex XML element. You may wish to consider extending the AbstractSimpleBeanDefinitionParser when you want to create a single bean definition from a relatively simple custom XML element. The resulting BeanDefinition will be automatically registered with the BeanDefinitionRegistry. Your job simply is to parse the custom XML Element into a single BeanDefinition.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/xml/AbstractSingleBeanDefinitionParser.html
BeanDefinitionDecorator	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface used by the DefaultBeanDefinitionDocumentReader to handle custom, nested (directly under a <bean>) tags. Decoration may also occur based on custom attributes applied to the <bean> tag. Implementations are free to turn the metadata in the custom tag into as many BeanDefinitions as required and to transform the BeanDefinition of the enclosing <bean> tag, potentially even returning a completely different BeanDefinition to replace the original. BeanDefinitionDecorators should be aware that they may be part of a chain. In particular, a BeanDefinitionDecorator should be aware that a previous BeanDefinitionDecorator may have replaced the original BeanDefinition with a ProxyFactoryBean definition allowing for custom interceptors to be added. BeanDefinitionDecorators that wish to add an interceptor to the enclosing bean should extend AbstractInterceptorDrivenBeanDefinitionDecorator which handles the chaining ensuring that only one proxy is created and that it contains all interceptors from the chain. The parser locates a BeanDefinitionDecorator from the NamespaceHandler for the namespace in which the custom tag resides.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/xml/BeanDefinitionDecorator.html
BeanDefinitionDocumentReader	A										<section class="prog__container">SPI for parsing an XML document that contains Spring bean definitions. Used by XmlBeanDefinitionReader for actually parsing a DOM document. Instantiated per document to parse: implementations can hold state in instance variables during the execution of the registerBeanDefinitions method — for example, global settings that are defined for all bean definitions in the document.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/xml/BeanDefinitionDocumentReader.html
BeanDefinitionParser	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface used by the DefaultBeanDefinitionDocumentReader to handle custom, top-level (directly under <beans/>) tags. Implementations are free to turn the metadata in the custom tag into as many BeanDefinitions as required. The parser locates a BeanDefinitionParser from the associated NamespaceHandler for the namespace in which the custom tag resides.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/xml/BeanDefinitionParser.html
BeanDefinitionParserDelegate	A										<section class="prog__container">Stateful delegate class used to parse XML bean definitions. Intended for use by both the main parser and any extension BeanDefinitionParsers or BeanDefinitionDecorators.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/xml/BeanDefinitionParserDelegate.html
BeansDtdResolver	A										<section class="prog__container">EntityResolver implementation for the Spring beans DTD, to load the DTD from the Spring class path (or JAR file). Fetches "spring-beans-2.0.dtd" from the class path resource "/org/springframework/beans/factory/xml/spring-beans-2.0.dtd", no matter whether specified as some local URL that includes "spring-beans" in the DTD name or as "http://www.springframework.org/dtd/spring-beans-2.0.dtd".</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/xml/BeansDtdResolver.html
DefaultBeanDefinitionDocumentReader	A										<section class="prog__container">Default implementation of the BeanDefinitionDocumentReader interface that reads bean definitions according to the "spring-beans" DTD and XSD format (Spring's default XML bean definition format). The structure, elements, and attribute names of the required XML document are hard-coded in this class. (Of course a transform could be run if necessary to produce this format). <beans> does not need to be the root element of the XML document: this class will parse all bean definition elements in the XML file, regardless of the actual root element.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/xml/DefaultBeanDefinitionDocumentReader.html
DefaultDocumentLoader	A										<section class="prog__container">Spring's default DocumentLoader implementation. Simply loads documents using the standard JAXP-configured XML parser. If you want to change the DocumentBuilder that is used to load documents, then one strategy is to define a corresponding Java system property when starting your JVM. For example, to use the Oracle DocumentBuilder, you might start your application like as follows: java -Djavax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory=oracle.xml.jaxp.JXDocumentBuilderFactory MyMainClass</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/xml/DefaultDocumentLoader.html
DefaultNamespaceHandlerResolver	A										<section class="prog__container">Default implementation of the NamespaceHandlerResolver interface. Resolves namespace URIs to implementation classes based on the mappings contained in mapping file. By default, this implementation looks for the mapping file at META-INF/spring.handlers, but this can be changed using the DefaultNamespaceHandlerResolver(ClassLoader, String) constructor.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/xml/DefaultNamespaceHandlerResolver.html
DelegatingEntityResolver	A										<section class="prog__container">EntityResolver implementation that delegates to a BeansDtdResolver and a PluggableSchemaResolver for DTDs and XML schemas, respectively.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/xml/DelegatingEntityResolver.html
DocumentDefaultsDefinition	A										<section class="prog__container">Simple JavaBean that holds the defaults specified at the <beans> level in a standard Spring XML bean definition document: default-lazy-init, default-autowire, etc.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/xml/DocumentDefaultsDefinition.html
DocumentLoader	A										<section class="prog__container">Strategy interface for loading an XML Document.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/xml/DocumentLoader.html
NamespaceHandler	A										<section class="prog__container">Base interface used by the DefaultBeanDefinitionDocumentReader for handling custom namespaces in a Spring XML configuration file. Implementations are expected to return implementations of the BeanDefinitionParser interface for custom top-level tags and implementations of the BeanDefinitionDecorator interface for custom nested tags. The parser will call parse(org.w3c.dom.Element, org.springframework.beans.factory.xml.ParserContext) when it encounters a custom tag directly under the <beans> tags and decorate(org.w3c.dom.Node, org.springframework.beans.factory.config.BeanDefinitionHolder, org.springframework.beans.factory.xml.ParserContext) when it encounters a custom tag directly under a <bean> tag. Developers writing their own custom element extensions typically will not implement this interface directly, but rather make use of the provided NamespaceHandlerSupport class.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/xml/NamespaceHandler.html
NamespaceHandlerResolver	A										<section class="prog__container">Used by the DefaultBeanDefinitionDocumentReader to locate a NamespaceHandler implementation for a particular namespace URI.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/xml/NamespaceHandlerResolver.html
NamespaceHandlerSupport	A										<section class="prog__container">Support class for implementing custom NamespaceHandlers. Parsing and decorating of individual Nodes is done via BeanDefinitionParser and BeanDefinitionDecorator strategy interfaces, respectively. Provides the registerBeanDefinitionParser(java.lang.String, org.springframework.beans.factory.xml.BeanDefinitionParser) and registerBeanDefinitionDecorator(java.lang.String, org.springframework.beans.factory.xml.BeanDefinitionDecorator) methods for registering a BeanDefinitionParser or BeanDefinitionDecorator to handle a specific element.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/xml/NamespaceHandlerSupport.html
ParserContext	A										<section class="prog__container">Context that gets passed along a bean definition parsing process, encapsulating all relevant configuration as well as state. Nested inside an XmlReaderContext.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/xml/ParserContext.html
PluggableSchemaResolver	A										<section class="prog__container">EntityResolver implementation that attempts to resolve schema URLs into local classpath resources using a set of mappings files. By default, this class will look for mapping files in the classpath using the pattern: META-INF/spring.schemas allowing for multiple files to exist on the classpath at any one time. The format of META-INF/spring.schemas is a properties file where each line should be of the form systemId=schema-location where schema-location should also be a schema file in the classpath. Since systemId is commonly a URL, one must be careful to escape any ':' characters which are treated as delimiters in properties files. The pattern for the mapping files can be overidden using the PluggableSchemaResolver(ClassLoader, String) constructor</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/xml/PluggableSchemaResolver.html
ResourceEntityResolver	A										<section class="prog__container">EntityResolver implementation that tries to resolve entity references through a ResourceLoader (usually, relative to the resource base of an ApplicationContext), if applicable. Extends DelegatingEntityResolver to also provide DTD and XSD lookup. Allows to use standard XML entities to include XML snippets into an application context definition, for example to split a large XML file into various modules. The include paths can be relative to the application context's resource base as usual, instead of relative to the JVM working directory (the XML parser's default). Note: In addition to relative paths, every URL that specifies a file in the current system root, i.e. the JVM working directory, will be interpreted relative to the application context too.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/xml/ResourceEntityResolver.html
SimpleConstructorNamespaceHandler	A										<section class="prog__container">Simple NamespaceHandler implementation that maps custom attributes directly through to bean properties. An important point to note is that this NamespaceHandler does not have a corresponding schema since there is no way to know in advance all possible attribute names. An example of the usage of this NamespaceHandler is shown below:  <bean id="author" class="..TestBean" c:name="Enescu" c:work-ref="compositions"/>  Here the 'c:name' corresponds directly to the 'name ' argument declared on the constructor of class 'TestBean'. The 'c:work-ref' attributes corresponds to the 'work' argument and, rather than being the concrete value, it contains the name of the bean that will be considered as a parameter. Note: This implementation supports only named parameters - there is no support for indexes or types. Further more, the names are used as hints by the container which, by default, does type introspection.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/xml/SimpleConstructorNamespaceHandler.html
SimplePropertyNamespaceHandler	A										<section class="prog__container">Simple NamespaceHandler implementation that maps custom attributes directly through to bean properties. An important point to note is that this NamespaceHandler does not have a corresponding schema since there is no way to know in advance all possible attribute names. An example of the usage of this NamespaceHandler is shown below:  <bean id="rob" class="..TestBean" p:name="Rob Harrop" p:spouse-ref="sally"/> Here the 'p:name' corresponds directly to the 'name' property on class 'TestBean'. The 'p:spouse-ref' attributes corresponds to the 'spouse' property and, rather than being the concrete value, it contains the name of the bean that will be injected into that property.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/xml/SimplePropertyNamespaceHandler.html
UtilNamespaceHandler	A										<section class="prog__container">NamespaceHandler for the util namespace.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/xml/UtilNamespaceHandler.html
XmlBeanDefinitionReader	A										<section class="prog__container">Bean definition reader for XML bean definitions. Delegates the actual XML document reading to an implementation of the BeanDefinitionDocumentReader interface. Typically applied to a DefaultListableBeanFactory or a GenericApplicationContext. This class loads a DOM document and applies the BeanDefinitionDocumentReader to it. The document reader will register each bean definition with the given bean factory, talking to the latter's implementation of the BeanDefinitionRegistry interface.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/xml/XmlBeanDefinitionReader.html
XmlBeanDefinitionStoreException	A										<section class="prog__container">XML-specific BeanDefinitionStoreException subclass that wraps a SAXException, typically a SAXParseException which contains information about the error location.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/xml/XmlBeanDefinitionStoreException.html
XmlBeanFactory	A										<section class="prog__container">Deprecated. as of Spring 3.1 in favor of DefaultListableBeanFactory and XmlBeanDefinitionReader</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/xml/XmlBeanFactory.html
XmlReaderContext	A										<section class="prog__container">Extension of ReaderContext, specific to use with an XmlBeanDefinitionReader. Provides access to the NamespaceHandlerResolver configured in the XmlBeanDefinitionReader.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/xml/XmlReaderContext.html
ByteArrayPropertyEditor	A										<section class="prog__container">Editor for byte arrays. Strings will simply be converted to their corresponding byte representations.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/propertyeditors/ByteArrayPropertyEditor.html
CharacterEditor	A										<section class="prog__container">Editor for a Character, to populate a property of type Character or char from a String value. Note that the JDK does not contain a default property editor for char! BeanWrapperImpl will register this editor by default. Also supports conversion from a Unicode character sequence; e.g. u0041 ('A').</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/propertyeditors/CharacterEditor.html
CharArrayPropertyEditor	A										<section class="prog__container">Editor for char arrays. Strings will simply be converted to their corresponding char representations.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/propertyeditors/CharArrayPropertyEditor.html
CharsetEditor	A										<section class="prog__container">Editor for java.nio.charset.Charset, translating charset String representations into Charset objects and back.

CustomBooleanEditor	A										<section class="prog__container">Property editor for Boolean/boolean properties. This is not meant to be used as system PropertyEditor but rather as locale-specific Boolean editor within custom controller code, to parse UI-caused boolean strings into boolean properties of beans and check them in the UI form. In web MVC code, this editor will typically be registered with binder.registerCustomEditor calls.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/propertyeditors/CustomBooleanEditor.html
CustomCollectionEditor	A										<section class="prog__container">Property editor for Collections, converting any source Collection to a given target Collection type.

FileEditor	A										<section class="prog__container">Editor for java.io.File, to directly populate a File property from a Spring resource location. Supports Spring-style URL notation: any fully qualified standard URL ("file:", "http:", etc) and Spring's special "classpath:" pseudo-URL. NOTE: The behavior of this editor has changed in Spring 2.0. Previously, it created a File instance directly from a filename. As of Spring 2.0, it takes a standard Spring resource location as input; this is consistent with URLEditor and InputStreamEditor now. NOTE: In Spring 2.5 the following modification was made. If a file name is specified without a URL prefix or without an absolute path then we try to locate the file using standard ResourceLoader semantics. If the file was not found, then a File instance is created assuming the file name refers to a relative file location.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/propertyeditors/FileEditor.html

ReaderEditor	A										<section class="prog__container">One-way PropertyEditor which can convert from a text String to a java.io.Reader, interpreting the given String as a Spring resource location (e.g. a URL String). Supports Spring-style URL notation: any fully qualified standard URL ("file:", "http:", etc.) and Spring's special "classpath:" pseudo-URL. Note that such readers usually do not get closed by Spring itself!</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/propertyeditors/ReaderEditor.html
ResourceBundleEditor	A										<section class="prog__container">PropertyEditor implementation for standard JDK ResourceBundles. Only supports conversion from a String, but not to a String.

Thanks to David Leal Valmana for the suggestion and initial prototype.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/propertyeditors/ResourceBundleEditor.html
StringArrayPropertyEditor	A										<section class="prog__container">Custom PropertyEditor for String arrays. Strings must be in CSV format, with a customizable separator. By default values in the result are trimmed of whitespace.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/propertyeditors/StringArrayPropertyEditor.html
StringTrimmerEditor	A										<section class="prog__container">Property editor that trims Strings. Optionally allows transforming an empty string into a null value.

Supports Spring-style URI notation: any fully qualified standard URI ("file:", "http:", etc) and Spring's special "classpath:" pseudo-URL, which will be resolved to a corresponding URI. By default, this editor will encode Strings into URIs. For instance, a space will be encoded into %20. This behavior can be changed by calling the URIEditor(boolean) constructor. Note: A URI is more relaxed than a URL in that it does not require a valid protocol to be specified. Any scheme within a valid URI syntax is allowed, even without a matching protocol handler being registered.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/propertyeditors/URIEditor.html

Supports Spring-style URL notation: any fully qualified standard URL ("file:", "http:", etc) and Spring's special "classpath:" pseudo-URL, as well as Spring's context-specific relative file paths. Note: A URL must specify a valid protocol, else it will be rejected upfront. However, the target resource does not necessarily have to exist at the time of URL creation; this depends on the specific resource type.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/propertyeditors/URLEditor.html
UUIDEditor	A										<section class="prog__container">Editor for java.util.UUID, translating UUID String representations into UUID objects and back.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/propertyeditors/UUIDEditor.html

PagedListHolder	A										<section class="prog__container">PagedListHolder is a simple state holder for handling lists of objects, separating them into pages. Page numbering starts with 0. This is mainly targetted at usage in web UIs. Typically, an instance will be instantiated with a list of beans, put into the session, and exported as model. The properties can all be set/get programmatically, but the most common way will be data binding, i.e. populating the bean from request parameters. The getters will mainly be used by the view. Supports sorting the underlying list via a SortDefinition implementation, available as property "sort". By default, a MutableSortDefinition instance will be used, toggling the ascending value on setting the same property again. The data binding names have to be called "pageSize" and "sort.ascending", as expected by BeanWrapper. Note that the names and the nesting syntax match the respective JSTL EL expressions, like "myModelAttr.pageSize" and "myModelAttr.sort.ascending".</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/support/PagedListHolder.html

AnnotationCacheOperationSource	A										<section class="prog__container">Implementation of the CacheOperationSource interface for working with caching metadata in annotation format. This class reads Spring's Cacheable, CachePut and CacheEvict annotations and exposes corresponding caching operation definition to Spring's cache infrastructure. This class may also serve as base class for a custom CacheOperationSource.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/cache/annotation/AnnotationCacheOperationSource.html
Cacheable	A										<section class="prog__container">Annotation indicating that the result of invoking a method (or all methods in a class) can be cached. Each time an advised method is invoked, caching behavior will be applied, checking whether the method has been already invoked for the given arguments. A sensible default simply uses the method parameters to compute the key, but a SpEL expression can be provided via the key() attribute, or a custom KeyGenerator implementation can replace the default one (see keyGenerator()). If no value is found in the cache for the computed key, the target method will be invoked and the returned value stored in the associated cache. Note that Java8's Optional return types are automatically handled and its content is stored in the cache if present. This annotation may be used as a meta-annotation to create custom composed annotations with attribute overrides.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/cache/annotation/Cacheable.html
CacheAnnotationParser	A										<section class="prog__container">Strategy interface for parsing known caching annotation types.

This annotation may be used as a meta-annotation to create custom composed annotations with attribute overrides.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/cache/annotation/CacheEvict.html
CachePut	A										<section class="prog__container">Annotation indicating that a method (or all methods on a class) triggers a cache put operation. In contrast to the @Cacheable annotation, this annotation does not cause the advised method to be skipped. Rather, it always causes the method to be invoked and its result to be stored in the associated cache. Note that Java8's Optional return types are automatically handled and its content is stored in the cache if present. This annotation may be used as a meta-annotation to create custom composed annotations with attribute overrides.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/cache/annotation/CachePut.html
Caching	A										<section class="prog__container">Group annotation for multiple cache annotations (of different or the same type).

CachingConfigurer	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface to be implemented by @Configuration classes annotated with @EnableCaching that wish or need to specify explicitly how caches are resolved and how keys are generated for annotation-driven cache management. Consider extending CachingConfigurerSupport, which provides a stub implementation of all interface methods. See @EnableCaching for general examples and context; see cacheManager(), cacheResolver() and keyGenerator() for detailed instructions.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/cache/annotation/CachingConfigurer.html
CachingConfigurerSupport	A										<section class="prog__container">An implementation of CachingConfigurer with empty methods allowing sub-classes to override only the methods they're interested in.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/cache/annotation/CachingConfigurerSupport.html
EnableCaching	A										<section class="prog__container">Enables Spring's annotation-driven cache management capability, similar to the support found in Spring's <cache:*> XML namespace. To be used together with @Configuration classes as follows:  @Configuration @EnableCaching public class AppConfig {     @Bean     public MyService myService() {         // configure and return a class having @Cacheable methods         return new MyService();     }     @Bean     public CacheManager cacheManager() {         // configure and return an implementation of Spring's CacheManager SPI         SimpleCacheManager cacheManager = new SimpleCacheManager();         cacheManager.setCaches(Arrays.asList(new ConcurrentMapCache("default")));         return cacheManager;     } }For reference, the example above can be compared to the following Spring XML configuration:  <beans>     <cache:annotation-driven/>     <bean id="myService" class="com.foo.MyService"/>     <bean id="cacheManager" class="org.springframework.cache.support.SimpleCacheManager">         <property name="caches">             <set>                 <bean class="org.springframework.cache.concurrent.ConcurrentMapCacheFactoryBean">                     <property name="name" value="default"/>                 </bean>             </set>         </property>     </bean> </beans>  In both of the scenarios above, @EnableCaching and <cache:annotation-driven/> are responsible for registering the necessary Spring components that power annotation-driven cache management, such as the CacheInterceptor and the proxy- or AspectJ-based advice that weaves the interceptor into the call stack when @Cacheable methods are invoked. If the JSR-107 API and Spring's JCache implementation are present, the necessary components to manage standard cache annotations are also registered. This creates the proxy- or AspectJ-based advice that weaves the interceptor into the call stack when methods annotated with CacheResult, CachePut, CacheRemove or CacheRemoveAll are invoked. A bean of type CacheManager must be registered, as there is no reasonable default that the framework can use as a convention. And whereas the <cache:annotation-driven> element assumes a bean named "cacheManager", @EnableCaching searches for a cache manager bean by type. Therefore, naming of the cache manager bean method is not significant. For those that wish to establish a more direct relationship between @EnableCaching and the exact cache manager bean to be used, the CachingConfigurer callback interface may be implemented. Notice the @Override-annotated methods below:  @Configuration @EnableCaching public class AppConfig extends CachingConfigurerSupport {     @Bean     public MyService myService() {         // configure and return a class having @Cacheable methods         return new MyService();     }     @Bean     @Override     public CacheManager cacheManager() {         // configure and return an implementation of Spring's CacheManager SPI         SimpleCacheManager cacheManager = new SimpleCacheManager();         cacheManager.setCaches(Arrays.asList(new ConcurrentMapCache("default")));         return cacheManager;     }     @Bean     @Override     public KeyGenerator keyGenerator() {         // configure and return an implementation of Spring's KeyGenerator SPI         return new MyKeyGenerator();     } } This approach may be desirable simply because it is more explicit, or it may be necessary in order to distinguish between two CacheManager beans present in the same container. Notice also the keyGenerator method in the example above. This allows for customizing the strategy for cache key generation, per Spring's KeyGenerator SPI. Normally, @EnableCaching will configure Spring's SimpleKeyGenerator for this purpose, but when implementing CachingConfigurer, a key generator must be provided explicitly. Return null or new SimpleKeyGenerator() from this method if no customization is necessary. CachingConfigurer offers additional customization options: it is recommended to extend from CachingConfigurerSupport that provides a default implementation for all methods which can be useful if you do not need to customize everything. See CachingConfigurer Javadoc for further details. The mode() attribute controls how advice is applied; if the mode is AdviceMode.PROXY (the default), then the other attributes such as proxyTargetClass() control the behavior of the proxying. If the mode() is set to AdviceMode.ASPECTJ, then the proxyTargetClass() attribute is obsolete. Note also that in this case the spring-aspects module JAR must be present on the classpath.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/cache/annotation/EnableCaching.html

Also supports a 'static' mode where the set of cache names is pre-defined through setCacheNames(java.util.Collection<java.lang.String>), with no dynamic creation of further cache regions at runtime. The configuration of the underlying cache can be fine-tuned through a Caffeine builder or CaffeineSpec, passed into this CacheManager through setCaffeine(com.github.benmanes.caffeine.cache.Caffeine<java.lang.Object, java.lang.Object>)/setCaffeineSpec(com.github.benmanes.caffeine.cache.CaffeineSpec). A CaffeineSpec-compliant expression value can also be applied via the "cacheSpecification" bean property. Requires Caffeine 2.1 or higher.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/cache/caffeine/CaffeineCacheManager.html
ConcurrentMapCache	A										<section class="prog__container">Simple Cache implementation based on the core JDK java.util.concurrent package. Useful for testing or simple caching scenarios, typically in combination with SimpleCacheManager or dynamically through ConcurrentMapCacheManager. Note: As ConcurrentHashMap (the default implementation used) does not allow for null values to be stored, this class will replace them with a predefined internal object. This behavior can be changed through the ConcurrentMapCache(String, ConcurrentMap, boolean) constructor.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/cache/concurrent/ConcurrentMapCache.html

ConcurrentMapCacheManager	A										<section class="prog__container">CacheManager implementation that lazily builds ConcurrentMapCache instances for each getCache(java.lang.String) request. Also supports a 'static' mode where the set of cache names is pre-defined through setCacheNames(java.util.Collection<java.lang.String>), with no dynamic creation of further cache regions at runtime. Note: This is by no means a sophisticated CacheManager; it comes with no cache configuration options. However, it may be useful for testing or simple caching scenarios.

If the specified named cache is not configured in the cache configuration descriptor, this FactoryBean will construct an instance of a Cache with the provided name and the specified cache properties and add it to the CacheManager for later retrieval. If some or all properties are not set at configuration time, this FactoryBean will use defaults. Note: If the named Cache instance is found, the properties will be ignored and the Cache instance will be retrieved from the CacheManager. Note: As of Spring 4.1, Spring's EhCache support requires EhCache 2.5 or higher.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/cache/ehcache/EhCacheFactoryBean.html
EhCacheManagerFactoryBean	A										<section class="prog__container">FactoryBean that exposes an EhCache CacheManager instance (independent or shared), configured from a specified config location. If no config location is specified, a CacheManager will be configured from "ehcache.xml" in the root of the class path (that is, default EhCache initialization - as defined in the EhCache docs - will apply). Setting up a separate EhCacheManagerFactoryBean is also advisable when using EhCacheFactoryBean, as it provides a (by default) independent CacheManager instance and cares for proper shutdown of the CacheManager. EhCacheManagerFactoryBean is also necessary for loading EhCache configuration from a non-default config location. Note: As of Spring 4.1, Spring's EhCache support requires EhCache 2.5 or higher.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/cache/ehcache/EhCacheManagerFactoryBean.html
EhCacheManagerUtils	A										<section class="prog__container">Convenient builder methods for EhCache 2.5+ CacheManager setup, providing easy programmatic bootstrapping from a Spring-provided resource. This is primarily intended for use within @Bean methods in a Spring configuration class. These methods are a simple alternative to custom CacheManager setup code. For any advanced purposes, consider using parseConfiguration(org.springframework.core.io.Resource), customizing the configuration object, and then calling the CacheManager.CacheManager(Configuration) constructor.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/cache/ehcache/EhCacheManagerUtils.html

GuavaCacheManager	A										<section class="prog__container">CacheManager implementation that lazily builds GuavaCache instances for each getCache(java.lang.String) request. Also supports a 'static' mode where the set of cache names is pre-defined through setCacheNames(java.util.Collection<java.lang.String>), with no dynamic creation of further cache regions at runtime. The configuration of the underlying cache can be fine-tuned through a Guava CacheBuilder or CacheBuilderSpec, passed into this CacheManager through setCacheBuilder(com.google.common.cache.CacheBuilder<java.lang.Object, java.lang.Object>)/setCacheBuilderSpec(com.google.common.cache.CacheBuilderSpec). A CacheBuilderSpec-compliant expression value can also be applied via the "cacheSpecification" bean property.

AbstractFallbackCacheOperationSource	A										<section class="prog__container">Abstract implementation of CacheOperation that caches attributes for methods and implements a fallback policy: 1. specific target method; 2. target class; 3. declaring method; 4. declaring class/interface. Defaults to using the target class's caching attribute if none is associated with the target method. Any caching attribute associated with the target method completely overrides a class caching attribute. If none found on the target class, the interface that the invoked method has been called through (in case of a JDK proxy) will be checked. This implementation caches attributes by method after they are first used. If it is ever desirable to allow dynamic changing of cacheable attributes (which is very unlikely), caching could be made configurable.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/cache/interceptor/AbstractFallbackCacheOperationSource.html

CacheErrorHandler	A										<section class="prog__container">A strategy for handling cache-related errors. In most cases, any exception thrown by the provider should simply be thrown back at the client but, in some circumstances, the infrastructure may need to handle cache-provider exceptions in a different way.

ApplicationContext	A										<section class="prog__container">Central interface to provide configuration for an application. This is read-only while the application is running, but may be reloaded if the implementation supports this. An ApplicationContext provides: Bean factory methods for accessing application components. Inherited from ListableBeanFactory. The ability to load file resources in a generic fashion. Inherited from the ResourceLoader interface. The ability to publish events to registered listeners. Inherited from the ApplicationEventPublisher interface. The ability to resolve messages, supporting internationalization. Inherited from the MessageSource interface. Inheritance from a parent context. Definitions in a descendant context will always take priority. This means, for example, that a single parent context can be used by an entire web application, while each servlet has its own child context that is independent of that of any other servlet. In addition to standard BeanFactory lifecycle capabilities, ApplicationContext implementations detect and invoke ApplicationContextAware beans as well as ResourceLoaderAware, ApplicationEventPublisherAware and MessageSourceAware beans.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/ApplicationContext.html
ApplicationContextAware	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface to be implemented by any object that wishes to be notified of the ApplicationContext that it runs in. Implementing this interface makes sense for example when an object requires access to a set of collaborating beans. Note that configuration via bean references is preferable to implementing this interface just for bean lookup purposes. This interface can also be implemented if an object needs access to file resources, i.e. wants to call getResource, wants to publish an application event, or requires access to the MessageSource. However, it is preferable to implement the more specific ResourceLoaderAware, ApplicationEventPublisherAware or MessageSourceAware interface in such a specific scenario. Note that file resource dependencies can also be exposed as bean properties of type Resource, populated via Strings with automatic type conversion by the bean factory. This removes the need for implementing any callback interface just for the purpose of accessing a specific file resource. ApplicationObjectSupport is a convenience base class for application objects, implementing this interface. For a list of all bean lifecycle methods, see the BeanFactory javadocs.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/ApplicationContextAware.html

Provides facilities to configure an application context in addition to the application context client methods in the ApplicationContext interface. Configuration and lifecycle methods are encapsulated here to avoid making them obvious to ApplicationContext client code.

Lifecycle	A										<section class="prog__container">A common interface defining methods for start/stop lifecycle control. The typical use case for this is to control asynchronous processing. NOTE: This interface does not imply specific auto-startup semantics. Consider implementing SmartLifecycle for that purpose.Can be implemented by both components (typically a Spring bean defined in a Spring context) and containers  (typically a Spring ApplicationContext itself). Containers will propagate start/stop signals to all components that apply within each container, e.g. for a stop/restart scenario at runtime. Can be used for direct invocations or for management operations via JMX. In the latter case, the MBeanExporter will typically be defined with an InterfaceBasedMBeanInfoAssembler, restricting the visibility of activity-controlled components to the Lifecycle interface. Note that the Lifecycle interface is only supported on top-level singleton beans. On any other component, the Lifecycle interface will remain undetected and hence ignored. Also, note that the extended SmartLifecycle interface provides integration with the application context's startup and shutdown phases.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/Lifecycle.html

ResourceLoaderAware	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface to be implemented by any object that wishes to be notified of the ResourceLoader (typically the ApplicationContext) that it runs in. This is an alternative to a full ApplicationContext dependency via the ApplicationContextAware interface. Note that Resource dependencies can also be exposed as bean properties of type Resource, populated via Strings with automatic type conversion by the bean factory. This removes the need for implementing any callback interface just for the purpose of accessing a specific file resource. You typically need a ResourceLoader when your application object has to access a variety of file resources whose names are calculated. A good strategy is to make the object use a DefaultResourceLoader but still implement ResourceLoaderAware to allow for overriding when running in an ApplicationContext. See ReloadableResourceBundleMessageSource for an example. A passed-in ResourceLoader can also be checked for the ResourcePatternResolver interface and cast accordingly, to be able to resolve resource patterns into arrays of Resource objects. This will always work when running in an ApplicationContext (the context interface extends ResourcePatternResolver). Use a PathMatchingResourcePatternResolver as default. See also the ResourcePatternUtils.getResourcePatternResolver method. As alternative to a ResourcePatternResolver dependency, consider exposing bean properties of type Resource array, populated via pattern Strings with automatic type conversion by the bean factory.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/ResourceLoaderAware.html
SmartLifecycle	A										<section class="prog__container">An extension of the Lifecycle interface for those objects that require to be started upon ApplicationContext refresh and/or shutdown in a particular order. The isAutoStartup() return value indicates whether this object should be started at the time of a context refresh. The callback-accepting stop(Runnable) method is useful for objects that have an asynchronous shutdown process. Any implementation of this interface must invoke the callback's run() method upon shutdown completion to avoid unnecessary delays in the overall ApplicationContext shutdown. This interface extends Phased, and the Phased.getPhase() method's return value indicates the phase within which this Lifecycle component should be started and stopped. The startup process begins with the lowest phase value and ends with the highest phase value (Integer.MIN_VALUE is the lowest possible, and Integer.MAX_VALUE is the highest possible). The shutdown process will apply the reverse order. Any components with the same value will be arbitrarily ordered within the same phase. Example: if component B depends on component A having already started, then component A should have a lower phase value than component B. During the shutdown process, component B would be stopped before component A. Any explicit "depends-on" relationship will take precedence over the phase order such that the dependent bean always starts after its dependency and always stops before its dependency. Any Lifecycle components within the context that do not also implement SmartLifecycle will be treated as if they have a phase value of 0. That way a SmartLifecycle implementation may start before those Lifecycle components if it has a negative phase value, or it may start after those components if it has a positive phase value. Note that, due to the auto-startup support in SmartLifecycle, a SmartLifecycle bean instance will get initialized on startup of the application context in any case. As a consequence, the bean definition lazy-init flag has very limited actual effect on SmartLifecycle beans.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/SmartLifecycle.html
ContextBeanFactoryReference	A										<section class="prog__container">ApplicationContext-specific implementation of BeanFactoryReference, wrapping a newly created ApplicationContext, closing it on release.

ContextSingletonBeanFactoryLocator	A										<section class="prog__container">Variant of SingletonBeanFactoryLocator which creates its internal bean factory reference as an ApplicationContext instead of SingletonBeanFactoryLocator's simple BeanFactory. For almost all usage scenarios, this will not make a difference, since within that ApplicationContext or BeanFactory you are still free to define either BeanFactory or ApplicationContext instances. The main reason one would need to use this class is if bean post-processing (or other ApplicationContext specific features are needed in the bean reference definition itself). Note: This class uses classpath*:beanRefContext.xml as the default resource location for the bean factory reference definition files.

AnnotationBeanNameGenerator	A										<section class="prog__container">BeanNameGenerator implementation for bean classes annotated with the @Component annotation or with another annotation that is itself annotated with @Component as a meta-annotation. For example, Spring's stereotype annotations (such as @Repository) are themselves annotated with @Component. Also supports Java EE 6's ManagedBean and JSR-330's Named annotations, if available. Note that Spring component annotations always override such standard annotations. If the annotation's value doesn't indicate a bean name, an appropriate name will be built based on the short name of the class (with the first letter lower-cased).

Allows for registering classes one by one using register(Class...) as well as for classpath scanning using scan(String...). In case of multiple @Configuration classes, @Bean methods defined in later classes will override those defined in earlier classes. This can be leveraged to deliberately override certain bean definitions via an extra @Configuration class.

Bean	A										<section class="prog__container">Indicates that a method produces a bean to be managed by the Spring container. OverviewThe names and semantics of the attributes to this annotation are intentionally similar to those of the <bean/> element in the Spring XML schema. For example:      @Bean     public MyBean myBean() {         // instantiate and configure MyBean obj         return obj;     } Bean NamesWhile a name() attribute is available, the default strategy for determining the name of a bean is to use the name of the @Bean method. This is convenient and intuitive, but if explicit naming is desired, the name attribute (or its alias value) may be used. Also note that name accepts an array of Strings, allowing for multiple names (i.e. a primary bean name plus one or more aliases) for a single bean.      @Bean({"b1", "b2"}) // bean available as 'b1' and 'b2', but not 'myBean'     public MyBean myBean() {         // instantiate and configure MyBean obj         return obj;     } Scope, DependsOn, Primary, and LazyNote that the @Bean annotation does not provide attributes for scope, depends-on, primary, or lazy. Rather, it should be used in conjunction with @Scope, @DependsOn, @Primary, and @Lazy annotations to achieve those semantics. For example:      @Bean     @Scope("prototype")     public MyBean myBean() {         // instantiate and configure MyBean obj         return obj;     } @Bean Methods in @Configuration ClassesTypically, @Bean methods are declared within @Configuration classes. In this case, bean methods may reference other @Bean methods in the same class by calling them directly. This ensures that references between beans are strongly typed and navigable. Such so-called 'inter-bean references' are guaranteed to respect scoping and AOP semantics, just like getBean() lookups would. These are the semantics known from the original 'Spring JavaConfig' project which require CGLIB subclassing of each such configuration class at runtime. As a consequence, @Configuration classes and their factory methods must not be marked as final or private in this mode. For example:  @Configuration public class AppConfig {     @Bean     public FooService fooService() {         return new FooService(fooRepository());     }     @Bean     public FooRepository fooRepository() {         return new JdbcFooRepository(dataSource());     }     // ... }@Bean Lite Mode@Bean methods may also be declared within classes that are not annotated with @Configuration. For example, bean methods may be declared in a @Component class or even in a plain old class. In such cases, a @Bean method will get processed in a so-called 'lite' mode. Bean methods in lite mode will be treated as plain factory methods by the container (similar to factory-method declarations in XML), with scoping and lifecycle callbacks properly applied. The containing class remains unmodified in this case, and there are no unusual constraints for the containing class or the factory methods. In contrast to the semantics for bean methods in @Configuration classes, 'inter-bean references' are not supported in lite mode. Instead, when one @Bean-method invokes another @Bean-method in lite mode, the invocation is a standard Java method invocation; Spring does not intercept the invocation via a CGLIB proxy. This is analogous to inter-@Transactional method calls where in proxy mode, Spring does not intercept the invocation — Spring does so only in AspectJ mode. For example:  @Component public class Calculator {     public int sum(int a, int b) {         return a+b;     }     @Bean     public MyBean myBean() {         return new MyBean();     } }BootstrappingSee @Configuration Javadoc for further details including how to bootstrap the container using AnnotationConfigApplicationContext and friends. BeanFactoryPostProcessor-returning @Bean methodsSpecial consideration must be taken for @Bean methods that return Spring BeanFactoryPostProcessor (BFPP) types. Because BFPP objects must be instantiated very early in the container lifecycle, they can interfere with processing of annotations such as @Autowired, @Value, and @PostConstruct within @Configuration classes. To avoid these lifecycle issues, mark BFPP-returning @Bean methods as static. For example:      @Bean     public static PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer ppc() {         // instantiate, configure and return ppc ...     }  By marking this method as static, it can be invoked without causing instantiation of its declaring @Configuration class, thus avoiding the above-mentioned lifecycle conflicts. Note however that static @Bean methods will not be enhanced for scoping and AOP semantics as mentioned above. This works out in BFPP cases, as they are not typically referenced by other @Bean methods. As a reminder, a WARN-level log message will be issued for any non-static @Bean methods having a return type assignable to BeanFactoryPostProcessor.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/Bean.html
ClassPathBeanDefinitionScanner	A										<section class="prog__container">A bean definition scanner that detects bean candidates on the classpath, registering corresponding bean definitions with a given registry (BeanFactory or ApplicationContext). Candidate classes are detected through configurable type filters. The default filters include classes that are annotated with Spring's @Component, @Repository, @Service, or @Controller stereotype. Also supports Java EE 6's ManagedBean and JSR-330's Named annotations, if available.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/ClassPathBeanDefinitionScanner.html
ClassPathScanningCandidateComponentProvider	A										<section class="prog__container">A component provider that scans the classpath from a base package. It then applies exclude and include filters to the resulting classes to find candidates. This implementation is based on Spring's MetadataReader facility, backed by an ASM ClassReader.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/ClassPathScanningCandidateComponentProvider.html
CommonAnnotationBeanPostProcessor	A										<section class="prog__container">BeanPostProcessor implementation that supports common Java annotations out of the box, in particular the JSR-250 annotations in the javax.annotation package. These common Java annotations are supported in many Java EE 5 technologies (e.g. JSF 1.2), as well as in Java 6's JAX-WS. This post-processor includes support for the PostConstruct and PreDestroy annotations - as init annotation and destroy annotation, respectively - through inheriting from InitDestroyAnnotationBeanPostProcessor with pre-configured annotation types. The central element is the Resource annotation for annotation-driven injection of named beans, by default from the containing Spring BeanFactory, with only mappedName references resolved in JNDI. The "alwaysUseJndiLookup" flag enforces JNDI lookups equivalent to standard Java EE 5 resource injection for name references and default names as well. The target beans can be simple POJOs, with no special requirements other than the type having to match. The JAX-WS WebServiceRef annotation is supported too, analogous to Resource but with the capability of creating specific JAX-WS service endpoints. This may either point to an explicitly defined resource by name or operate on a locally specified JAX-WS service class. Finally, this post-processor also supports the EJB 3 EJB annotation, analogous to Resource as well, with the capability to specify both a local bean name and a global JNDI name for fallback retrieval. The target beans can be plain POJOs as well as EJB 3 Session Beans in this case. The common annotations supported by this post-processor are available in Java 6 (JDK 1.6) as well as in Java EE 5/6 (which provides a standalone jar for its common annotations as well, allowing for use in any Java 5 based application). For default usage, resolving resource names as Spring bean names, simply define the following in your application context:  <bean class="org.springframework.context.annotation.CommonAnnotationBeanPostProcessor"/> For direct JNDI access, resolving resource names as JNDI resource references within the Java EE application's "java:comp/env/" namespace, use the following:  <bean class="org.springframework.context.annotation.CommonAnnotationBeanPostProcessor">   <property name="alwaysUseJndiLookup" value="true"/> </bean>mappedName references will always be resolved in JNDI, allowing for global JNDI names (including "java:" prefix) as well. The "alwaysUseJndiLookup" flag just affects name references and default names (inferred from the field name / property name). NOTE: A default CommonAnnotationBeanPostProcessor will be registered by the "context:annotation-config" and "context:component-scan" XML tags. Remove or turn off the default annotation configuration there if you intend to specify a custom CommonAnnotationBeanPostProcessor bean definition! NOTE: Annotation injection will be performed before XML injection; thus the latter configuration will override the former for properties wired through both approaches.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/CommonAnnotationBeanPostProcessor.html

ComponentScan	A										<section class="prog__container">Configures component scanning directives for use with @Configuration classes. Provides support parallel with Spring XML's <context:component-scan> element. Either basePackageClasses() or basePackages() (or its alias value()) may be specified to define specific packages to scan. If specific packages are not defined, scanning will occur from the package of the class that declares this annotation. Note that the <context:component-scan> element has an annotation-config attribute; however, this annotation does not. This is because in almost all cases when using @ComponentScan, default annotation config processing (e.g. processing @Autowired and friends) is assumed. Furthermore, when using AnnotationConfigApplicationContext, annotation config processors are always registered, meaning that any attempt to disable them at the @ComponentScan level would be ignored.

Condition	A										<section class="prog__container">A single condition that must be matched in order for a component to be registered. Conditions are checked immediately before the bean-definition is due to be registered and are free to veto registration based on any criteria that can be determined at that point. Conditions must follow the same restrictions as BeanFactoryPostProcessor and take care to never interact with bean instances. For more fine-grained control of conditions that interact with @Configuration beans consider the ConfigurationCondition interface.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/Condition.html
Conditional	A										<section class="prog__container">Indicates that a component is only eligible for registration when all specified conditions match. A condition is any state that can be determined programmatically before the bean definition is due to be registered (see Condition for details). The @Conditional annotation may be used in any of the following ways: as a type-level annotation on any class directly or indirectly annotated with @Component, including @Configuration classesas a meta-annotation, for the purpose of composing custom stereotype annotationsas a method-level annotation on any @Bean methodIf a @Configuration class is marked with @Conditional, all of the @Bean methods, @Import annotations, and @ComponentScan annotations associated with that class will be subject to the conditions. NOTE: Inheritance of @Conditional annotations is not supported; any conditions from superclasses or from overridden methods will not be considered. In order to enforce these semantics, @Conditional itself is not declared as @Inherited; furthermore, any custom composed annotation that is meta-annotated with @Conditional must not be declared as @Inherited.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/Conditional.html

Configuration	A										<section class="prog__container">Indicates that a class declares one or more @Bean methods and may be processed by the Spring container to generate bean definitions and service requests for those beans at runtime, for example:  @Configuration public class AppConfig {     @Bean     public MyBean myBean() {         // instantiate, configure and return bean ...     } }Bootstrapping @Configuration classesVia AnnotationConfigApplicationContext@Configuration classes are typically bootstrapped using either AnnotationConfigApplicationContext or its web-capable variant, AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext. A simple example with the former follows:  AnnotationConfigApplicationContext ctx = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(); ctx.register(AppConfig.class); ctx.refresh(); MyBean myBean = ctx.getBean(MyBean.class); // use myBean ...  See AnnotationConfigApplicationContext Javadoc for further details and see AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext for web.xml configuration instructions. Via Spring <beans> XMLAs an alternative to registering @Configuration classes directly against an AnnotationConfigApplicationContext, @Configuration classes may be declared as normal <bean> definitions within Spring XML files:  <beans>    <context:annotation-config/>    <bean class="com.acme.AppConfig"/> </beans> In the example above, <context:annotation-config/> is required in order to enable ConfigurationClassPostProcessor and other annotation-related post processors that facilitate handling @Configuration classes. Via component scanning@Configuration is meta-annotated with @Component, therefore @Configuration classes are candidates for component scanning (typically using Spring XML's <context:component-scan/> element) and therefore may also take advantage of @Autowired/@Inject like any regular @Component. In particular, if a single constructor is present autowiring semantics will be applied transparently:  @Configuration public class AppConfig {     private final SomeBean someBean;     public AppConfig(SomeBean someBean) {         this.someBean = someBean;     }     // @Bean definition using "SomeBean" }@Configuration classes may not only be bootstrapped using component scanning, but may also themselves configure component scanning using the @ComponentScan annotation:  @Configuration @ComponentScan("com.acme.app.services") public class AppConfig {     // various @Bean definitions ... } See the @ComponentScan javadoc for details.

DeferredImportSelector	A										<section class="prog__container">A variation of ImportSelector that runs after all @Configuration beans have been processed.

DependsOn	A										<section class="prog__container">Beans on which the current bean depends. Any beans specified are guaranteed to be created by the container before this bean. Used infrequently in cases where a bean does not explicitly depend on another through properties or constructor arguments, but rather depends on the side effects of another bean's initialization. May be used on any class directly or indirectly annotated with Component or on methods annotated with Bean. Using DependsOn at the class level has no effect unless component-scanning is being used. If a DependsOn-annotated class is declared via XML, DependsOn annotation metadata is ignored, and <bean depends-on="..."/> is respected instead.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/DependsOn.html

EnableAspectJAutoProxy	A										<section class="prog__container">Enables support for handling components marked with AspectJ's @Aspect annotation, similar to functionality found in Spring's <aop:aspectj-autoproxy> XML element. To be used on @Configuration classes as follows:  @Configuration @EnableAspectJAutoProxy public class AppConfig {     @Bean     public FooService fooService() {         return new FooService();     }     @Bean     public MyAspect myAspect() {         return new MyAspect();     } } Where FooService is a typical POJO component and MyAspect is an @Aspect-style aspect:  public class FooService {     // various methods } @Aspect public class MyAspect {     @Before("execution(* FooService+.*(..))")     public void advice() {         // advise FooService methods as appropriate     } } In the scenario above, @EnableAspectJAutoProxy ensures that MyAspect will be properly processed and that FooService will be proxied mixing in the advice that it contributes. Users can control the type of proxy that gets created for FooService using the proxyTargetClass() attribute. The following enables CGLIB-style 'subclass' proxies as opposed to the default interface-based JDK proxy approach.  @Configuration @EnableAspectJAutoProxy(proxyTargetClass=true) public class AppConfig {     // ... }Note that @Aspect beans may be component-scanned like any other. Simply mark the aspect with both @Aspect and @Component:  package com.foo; @Component public class FooService { ... } @Aspect @Component public class MyAspect { ... } Then use the @ComponentScan annotation to pick both up:  @Configuration @ComponentScan("com.foo") @EnableAspectJAutoProxy public class AppConfig {     // no explicit &#</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/EnableAspectJAutoProxy.html

EnableLoadTimeWeaving	A										<section class="prog__container">Activates a Spring LoadTimeWeaver for this application context, available as a bean with the name "loadTimeWeaver", similar to the <context:load-time-weaver> element in Spring XML. To be used on @Configuration classes; the simplest possible example of which follows:  @Configuration @EnableLoadTimeWeaving public class AppConfig {     // application-specific @Bean definitions ... } The example above is equivalent to the following Spring XML configuration:  <beans>     <context:load-time-weaver/>     <!-- application-specific <bean> definitions --> </beans> The LoadTimeWeaverAware interface Any bean that implements the LoadTimeWeaverAware interface will then receive the LoadTimeWeaver reference automatically; for example, Spring's JPA bootstrap support. Customizing the LoadTimeWeaver The default weaver is determined automatically: see DefaultContextLoadTimeWeaver. To customize the weaver used, the @Configuration class annotated with @EnableLoadTimeWeaving may also implement the LoadTimeWeavingConfigurer interface and return a custom LoadTimeWeaver instance through the #getLoadTimeWeaver method:  @Configuration @EnableLoadTimeWeaving public class AppConfig implements LoadTimeWeavingConfigurer {     @Override     public LoadTimeWeaver getLoadTimeWeaver() {         MyLoadTimeWeaver ltw = new MyLoadTimeWeaver();         ltw.addClassTransformer(myClassFileTransformer);         // ...         return ltw;     } }The example above can be compared to the following Spring XML configuration:  <beans>     <context:load-time-weaver weaverClass="com.acme.MyLoadTimeWeaver"/> </beans> The code example differs from the XML example in that it actually instantiates the MyLoadTimeWeaver type, meaning that it can also configure the instance, e.g. calling the #addClassTransformer method. This demonstrates how the code-based configuration approach is more flexible through direct programmatic access. Enabling AspectJ-based weaving AspectJ load-time weaving may be enabled with the aspectjWeaving() attribute, which will cause the AspectJ class transformer to be registered through LoadTimeWeaver.addTransformer(java.lang.instrument.ClassFileTransformer). AspectJ weaving will be activated by default if a "META-INF/aop.xml" resource is present on the classpath. Example:  @Configuration @EnableLoadTimeWeaving(aspectjWeaving=ENABLED) public class AppConfig { }The example above can be compared to the following Spring XML configuration:  <beans>     <context:load-time-weaver aspectj-weaving="on"/> </beans> The two examples are equivalent with one significant exception: in the XML case, the functionality of <context:spring-configured> is implicitly enabled when aspectj-weaving is "on".  This does not occur when using @EnableLoadTimeWeaving(aspectjWeaving=ENABLED). Instead you must explicitly add @EnableSpringConfigured (included in the spring-aspects module)</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/EnableLoadTimeWeaving.html
EnableMBeanExport	A										<section class="prog__container">Enables default exporting of all standard MBeans from the Spring context, as well as well all @ManagedResource annotated beans. The resulting MBeanExporter bean is defined under the name "mbeanExporter". Alternatively, consider defining a custom AnnotationMBeanExporter bean explicitly. This annotation is modeled after and functionally equivalent to Spring XML's <context:mbean-export/> element.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/EnableMBeanExport.html
FilterType	A										<section class="prog__container">Enumeration of the type filters that may be used in conjunction with @ComponentScan.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/FilterType.html
Import	A										<section class="prog__container">Indicates one or more @Configuration classes to import. Provides functionality equivalent to the <import/> element in Spring XML. Allows for importing @Configuration classes, ImportSelector and ImportBeanDefinitionRegistrar implementations, as well as regular component classes (as of 4.2; analogous to AnnotationConfigApplicationContext.register(java.lang.Class<?>...)). @Bean definitions declared in imported @Configuration classes should be accessed by using @Autowired injection. Either the bean itself can be autowired, or the configuration class instance declaring the bean can be autowired. The latter approach allows for explicit, IDE-friendly navigation between @Configuration class methods. May be declared at the class level or as a meta-annotation. If XML or other non-@Configuration bean definition resources need to be imported, use the @ImportResource annotation instead.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/Import.html
ImportAware	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface to be implemented by any @Configuration class that wishes to be injected with the AnnotationMetadata of the @Configuration class that imported it. Useful in conjunction with annotations that use @Import as a meta-annotation.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/ImportAware.html
ImportBeanDefinitionRegistrar	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface to be implemented by types that register additional bean definitions when processing @Configuration classes. Useful when operating at the bean definition level (as opposed to @Bean method/instance level) is desired or necessary. Along with @Configuration and ImportSelector, classes of this type may be provided to the @Import annotation (or may also be returned from an ImportSelector). An ImportBeanDefinitionRegistrar may implement any of the following Aware interfaces, and their respective methods will be called prior to registerBeanDefinitions(org.springframework.core.type.AnnotationMetadata, org.springframework.beans.factory.support.BeanDefinitionRegistry): EnvironmentAwareBeanFactoryAwareBeanClassLoaderAwareResourceLoaderAwareSee implementations and associated unit tests for usage examples.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/ImportBeanDefinitionRegistrar.html
ImportResource	A										<section class="prog__container">Indicates one or more resources containing bean definitions to import. Like @Import, this annotation provides functionality similar to the <import/> element in Spring XML. It is typically used when designing @Configuration classes to be bootstrapped by an AnnotationConfigApplicationContext, but where some XML functionality such as namespaces is still necessary. By default, arguments to the value() attribute will be processed using a GroovyBeanDefinitionReader if ending in ".groovy"; otherwise, an XmlBeanDefinitionReader will be used to parse Spring <beans/> XML files. Optionally, the reader() attribute may be declared, allowing the user to choose a custom BeanDefinitionReader implementation.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/ImportResource.html
ImportSelector	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface to be implemented by types that determine which @Configuration class(es) should be imported based on a given selection criteria, usually one or more annotation attributes. An ImportSelector may implement any of the following Aware interfaces, and their respective methods will be called prior to selectImports(org.springframework.core.type.AnnotationMetadata): EnvironmentAwareBeanFactoryAwareBeanClassLoaderAwareResourceLoaderAwareImportSelectors are usually processed in the same way as regular @Import annotations, however, it is also possible to defer selection of imports until all @Configuration classes have been processed (see DeferredImportSelector for details).</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/ImportSelector.html
Jsr330ScopeMetadataResolver	A										<section class="prog__container">Simple ScopeMetadataResolver implementation that follows JSR-330 scoping rules: defaulting to prototype scope unless Singleton is present. This scope resolver can be used with ClassPathBeanDefinitionScanner and AnnotatedBeanDefinitionReader for standard JSR-330 compliance. However, in practice, you will typically use Spring's rich default scoping instead - or extend this resolver with custom scoping annotations that point to extended Spring scopes.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/Jsr330ScopeMetadataResolver.html
Lazy	A										<section class="prog__container">Indicates whether a bean is to be lazily initialized. May be used on any class directly or indirectly annotated with @Component or on methods annotated with @Bean. If this annotation is not present on a @Component or @Bean definition, eager initialization will occur. If present and set to true, the @Bean or @Component will not be initialized until referenced by another bean or explicitly retrieved from the enclosing BeanFactory. If present and set to false, the bean will be instantiated on startup by bean factories that perform eager initialization of singletons. If Lazy is present on a @Configuration class, this indicates that all @Bean methods within that @Configuration should be lazily initialized. If @Lazy is present and false on a @Bean method within a @Lazy-annotated @Configuration class, this indicates overriding the 'default lazy' behavior and that the bean should be eagerly initialized. In addition to its role for component initialization, this annotation may also be placed on injection points marked with Autowired or Inject: In that context, it leads to the creation of a lazy-resolution proxy for all affected dependencies, as an alternative to using ObjectFactory or Provider.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/Lazy.html
LoadTimeWeavingConfiguration	A										<section class="prog__container">@Configuration class that registers a LoadTimeWeaver bean. This configuration class is automatically imported when using the EnableLoadTimeWeaving annotation. See @EnableLoadTimeWeaving javadoc for complete usage details.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/LoadTimeWeavingConfiguration.html
LoadTimeWeavingConfigurer	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface to be implemented by @Configuration classes annotated with @EnableLoadTimeWeaving that wish to customize the LoadTimeWeaver instance to be used. See @EnableAsync for usage examples and information on how a default LoadTimeWeaver is selected when this interface is not used.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/LoadTimeWeavingConfigurer.html
MBeanExportConfiguration	A										<section class="prog__container">@Configuration class that registers a AnnotationMBeanExporter bean. This configuration class is automatically imported when using the EnableMBeanExport annotation. See its javadoc for complete usage details.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/MBeanExportConfiguration.html
MBeanExportConfiguration.SpecificPlatform	A										<section class="prog__container">Returns the enum constant of this type with the specified name.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/MBeanExportConfiguration.SpecificPlatform.html
Primary	A										<section class="prog__container">Indicates that a bean should be given preference when multiple candidates are qualified to autowire a single-valued dependency. If exactly one 'primary' bean exists among the candidates, it will be the autowired value. This annotation is semantically equivalent to the <bean> element's primary attribute in Spring XML. May be used on any class directly or indirectly annotated with @Component or on methods annotated with @Bean. Example @Component public class FooService {     private FooRepository fooRepository;     @Autowired     public FooService(FooRepository fooRepository) {         this.fooRepository = fooRepository;     } } @Component public class JdbcFooRepository {     public JdbcFooService(DataSource dataSource) {         // ...     } } @Primary @Component public class HibernateFooRepository {     public HibernateFooService(SessionFactory sessionFactory) {         // ...     } } Because HibernateFooRepository is marked with @Primary, it will be injected preferentially over the jdbc-based variant assuming both are present as beans within the same Spring application context, which is often the case when component-scanning is applied liberally. Note that using @Primary at the class level has no effect unless component-scanning is being used. If a @Primary-annotated class is declared via XML, @Primary annotation metadata is ignored, and <bean primary="true|false"/> is respected instead.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/Primary.html
Profile	A										<section class="prog__container">Indicates that a component is eligible for registration when one or more specified profiles are active. A profile is a named logical grouping that may be activated programmatically via ConfigurableEnvironment.setActiveProfiles(java.lang.String...) or declaratively by setting the spring.profiles.active property as a JVM system property, as an environment variable, or as a Servlet context parameter in web.xml for web applications. Profiles may also be activated declaratively in integration tests via the @ActiveProfiles annotation. The @Profile annotation may be used in any of the following ways: as a type-level annotation on any class directly or indirectly annotated with @Component, including @Configuration classesas a meta-annotation, for the purpose of composing custom stereotype annotationsas a method-level annotation on any @Bean methodIf a @Configuration class is marked with @Profile, all of the @Bean methods and @Import annotations associated with that class will be bypassed unless one or more of the specified profiles are active. This is analogous to the behavior in Spring XML: if the profile attribute of the beans element is supplied e.g., <beans profile="p1,p2">, the beans element will not be parsed unless at least profile 'p1' or 'p2' has been activated. Likewise, if a @Component or @Configuration class is marked with @Profile({"p1", "p2"}), that class will not be registered or processed unless at least profile 'p1' or 'p2' has been activated. If a given profile is prefixed with the NOT operator (!), the annotated component will be registered if the profile is not active — for example, given @Profile({"p1", "!p2"}), registration will occur if profile 'p1' is active or if profile 'p2' is not active. If the @Profile annotation is omitted, registration will occur regardless of which (if any) profiles are active. When defining Spring beans via XML, the "profile" attribute of the <beans> element may be used. See the documentation in the spring-beans XSD (version 3.1 or greater) for details.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/Profile.html
PropertySource	A										<section class="prog__container">Annotation providing a convenient and declarative mechanism for adding a PropertySource to Spring's Environment. To be used in conjunction with @Configuration classes. Example usageGiven a file app.properties containing the key/value pair testbean.name=myTestBean, the following @Configuration class uses @PropertySource to contribute app.properties to the Environment's set of PropertySources.  @Configuration @PropertySource("classpath:/com/myco/app.properties") public class AppConfig {     @Autowired     Environment env;     @Bean     public TestBean testBean() {         TestBean testBean = new TestBean();         testBean.setName(env.getProperty("testbean.name"));         return testBean;     } } Notice that the Environment object is @Autowired into the configuration class and then used when populating the TestBean object. Given the configuration above, a call to testBean.getName() will return "myTestBean". Resolving ${...} placeholders in <bean> and @Value annotations In order to resolve ${...} placeholders in <bean> definitions or @Value annotations using properties from a PropertySource, one must register a PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer. This happens automatically when using <context:property-placeholder> in XML, but must be explicitly registered using a static @Bean method when using @Configuration classes. See the "Working with externalized values" section of @Configuration's javadoc and "a note on BeanFactoryPostProcessor-returning @Bean methods" of @Bean's javadoc for details and examples. Resolving ${...} placeholders within @PropertySource resource locations Any ${...} placeholders present in a @PropertySource resource location will be resolved against the set of property sources already registered against the environment. For example:  @Configuration @PropertySource("classpath:/com/${my.placeholder:default/path}/app.properties") public class AppConfig {     @Autowired     Environment env;     @Bean     public TestBean testBean() {         TestBean testBean = new TestBean();         testBean.setName(env.getProperty("testbean.name"));         return testBean;     } } Assuming that "my.placeholder" is present in one of the property sources already registered, e.g. system properties or environment variables, the placeholder will be resolved to the corresponding value. If not, then "default/path" will be used as a default. Expressing a default value (delimited by colon ":") is optional.  If no default is specified and a property cannot be resolved, an IllegalArgumentException will be thrown. A note on property overriding with @PropertySource In cases where a given property key exists in more than one .properties file, the last @PropertySource annotation processed will 'win' and override. For example, given two properties files a.properties and b.properties, consider the following two configuration classes that reference them with @PropertySource annotations:  @Configuration @PropertySource("classpath:/com/myco/a.properties") public class ConfigA { } @Configuration @PropertySource("classpath:/com/myco/b.properties") public class ConfigB { }  The override ordering depends on the order in which these classes are registered with the application context.  AnnotationConfigApplicationContext ctx =     new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(); ctx.register(ConfigA.class); ctx.register(ConfigB.class); ctx.refresh();  In the scenario above, the properties in b.properties will override any duplicates that exist in a.properties, because ConfigB was registered last. In certain situations, it may not be possible or practical to tightly control property source ordering when using @ProperySource annotations. For example, if the @Configuration classes above were registered via component-scanning, the ordering is difficult to predict. In such cases - and if overriding is important - it is recommended that the user fall back to using the programmatic PropertySource API. See ConfigurableEnvironment and MutablePropertySources javadocs for details.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/PropertySource.html
PropertySources	A										<section class="prog__container">Container annotation that aggregates several PropertySource annotations. Can be used natively, declaring several nested PropertySource annotations. Can also be used in conjunction with Java 8's support for repeatable annotations, where PropertySource can simply be declared several times on the same type, implicitly generating this container annotation.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/PropertySources.html
Role	A										<section class="prog__container">Indicates the 'role' hint for a given bean. May be used on any class directly or indirectly annotated with Component or on methods annotated with Bean. If this annotation is not present on a Component or Bean definition, the default value of BeanDefinition.ROLE_APPLICATION will apply. If Role is present on a @Configuration class, this indicates the role of the configuration class bean definition and does not cascade to all @Bean methods defined within. This behavior is different than that of the @Lazy annotation, for example.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/Role.html
ScannedGenericBeanDefinition	A										<section class="prog__container">Extension of the GenericBeanDefinition class, based on an ASM ClassReader, with support for annotation metadata exposed through the AnnotatedBeanDefinition interface. This class does not load the bean Class early. It rather retrieves all relevant metadata from the ".class" file itself, parsed with the ASM ClassReader. It is functionally equivalent to AnnotatedGenericBeanDefinition.AnnotatedGenericBeanDefinition(AnnotationMetadata) but distinguishes by type beans that have been scanned vs those that have been otherwise registered or detected by other means.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/ScannedGenericBeanDefinition.html
Scope	A										<section class="prog__container">When used as a type-level annotation in conjunction with @Component, @Scope indicates the name of a scope to use for instances of the annotated type. When used as a method-level annotation in conjunction with @Bean, @Scope indicates the name of a scope to use for the instance returned from the method. In this context, scope means the lifecycle of an instance, such as singleton, prototype, and so forth. Scopes provided out of the box in Spring may be referred to using the SCOPE_* constants available in the ConfigurableBeanFactory and WebApplicationContext interfaces. To register additional custom scopes, see CustomScopeConfigurer.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/Scope.html
ScopedProxyMode	A										<section class="prog__container">Enumerates the various scoped-proxy options. For a more complete discussion of exactly what a scoped proxy is, see the section of the Spring reference documentation entitled 'Scoped beans as dependencies'.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/ScopedProxyMode.html
ScopeMetadata	A										<section class="prog__container">Describes scope characteristics for a Spring-managed bean including the scope name and the scoped-proxy behavior. The default scope is "singleton", and the default is to not create scoped-proxies.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/ScopeMetadata.html

EnableSpringConfigured	A										<section class="prog__container">Signals the current application context to apply dependency injection to non-managed classes that are instantiated outside of the Spring bean factory (typically classes annotated with the @Configurable annotation). Similar to functionality found in Spring's <context:spring-configured> XML element. Often used in conjunction with @EnableLoadTimeWeaving.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/aspectj/EnableSpringConfigured.html
SpringConfiguredConfiguration	A										<section class="prog__container">@Configuration class that registers an AnnotationBeanConfigurerAspect capable of performing dependency injection services for non-Spring managed objects annotated with @Configurable. This configuration class is automatically imported when using the @EnableSpringConfigured annotation. See @EnableSpringConfigured's javadoc for complete usage details.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/aspectj/SpringConfiguredConfiguration.html
ContextNamespaceHandler	A										<section class="prog__container">NamespaceHandler for the 'context' namespace.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/config/ContextNamespaceHandler.html
AbstractApplicationEventMulticaster	A										<section class="prog__container">Abstract implementation of the ApplicationEventMulticaster interface, providing the basic listener registration facility. Doesn't permit multiple instances of the same listener by default, as it keeps listeners in a linked Set. The collection class used to hold ApplicationListener objects can be overridden through the "collectionClass" bean property. Implementing ApplicationEventMulticaster's actual ApplicationEventMulticaster.multicastEvent(org.springframework.context.ApplicationEvent) method is left to subclasses. SimpleApplicationEventMulticaster simply multicasts all events to all registered listeners, invoking them in the calling thread. Alternative implementations could be more sophisticated in those respects.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/event/AbstractApplicationEventMulticaster.html

ApplicationEventMulticaster	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface to be implemented by objects that can manage a number of ApplicationListener objects, and publish events to them. An ApplicationEventPublisher, typically a Spring ApplicationContext, can use an ApplicationEventMulticaster as a delegate for actually publishing events.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/event/ApplicationEventMulticaster.html
ApplicationListenerMethodAdapter	A										<section class="prog__container">GenericApplicationListener adapter that delegates the processing of an event to an EventListener annotated method. Delegates to processEvent(ApplicationEvent) to give sub-classes a chance to deviate from the default. Unwraps the content of a PayloadApplicationEvent if necessary to allow method declaration to define any arbitrary event type. If a condition is defined, it is evaluated prior to invoking the underlying method.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/event/ApplicationListenerMethodAdapter.html

DefaultEventListenerFactory	A										<section class="prog__container">Default EventListenerFactory implementation that supports the regular EventListener annotation. Used as "catch-all" implementation by default.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/event/DefaultEventListenerFactory.html
EventListener	A										<section class="prog__container">Annotation that marks a method as a listener for application events. If an annotated method supports a single event type, the method may declare a single parameter that reflects the event type to listen to. If an annotated method supports multiple event types, this annotation may refer to one or more supported event types using the classes attribute. See the classes() javadoc for further details. Events can be ApplicationEvent instances as well as arbitrary objects. Processing of @EventListener annotations is performed via the internal EventListenerMethodProcessor bean which gets registered automatically when using Java config or manually via the <context:annotation-config/> or <context:component-scan/> element when using XML config. Annotated methods may have a non-void return type. When they do, the result of the method invocation is sent as a new event. If the return type is either an array or a collection, each element is sent as a new individual event. It is also possible to define the order in which listeners for a certain event are to be invoked. To do so, add Spring's common @Order annotation alongside this event listener annotation. While it is possible for an event listener to declare that it throws arbitrary exception types, any checked exceptions thrown from an event listener will be wrapped in an UndeclaredThrowableException since the event publisher can only handle runtime exceptions.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/event/EventListener.html

SimpleApplicationEventMulticaster	A										<section class="prog__container">Simple implementation of the ApplicationEventMulticaster interface. Multicasts all events to all registered listeners, leaving it up to the listeners to ignore events that they are not interested in. Listeners will usually perform corresponding instanceof checks on the passed-in event object. By default, all listeners are invoked in the calling thread. This allows the danger of a rogue listener blocking the entire application, but adds minimal overhead. Specify an alternative task executor to have listeners executed in different threads, for example from a thread pool.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/event/SimpleApplicationEventMulticaster.html
SmartApplicationListener	A										<section class="prog__container">Extended variant of the standard ApplicationListener interface, exposing further metadata such as the supported event type. Users are strongly advised to use the GenericApplicationListener interface instead as it provides an improved detection of generics-based event types.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/event/SmartApplicationListener.html
SourceFilteringListener	A										<section class="prog__container">ApplicationListener decorator that filters events from a specified event source, invoking its delegate listener for matching ApplicationEvent objects only. Can also be used as base class, overriding the onApplicationEventInternal(org.springframework.context.ApplicationEvent) method instead of specifying a delegate listener.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/event/SourceFilteringListener.html

SimpleLocaleContext	A										<section class="prog__container">Simple implementation of the LocaleContext interface, always returning a specified Locale.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/i18n/SimpleLocaleContext.html
SimpleTimeZoneAwareLocaleContext	A										<section class="prog__container">Simple implementation of the TimeZoneAwareLocaleContext interface, always returning a specified Locale and TimeZone. Note: Prefer the use of SimpleLocaleContext when only setting a Locale but no TimeZone.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/i18n/SimpleTimeZoneAwareLocaleContext.html
TimeZoneAwareLocaleContext	A										<section class="prog__container">Extension of LocaleContext, adding awareness of the current time zone. Having this variant of LocaleContext set to LocaleContextHolder means that some TimeZone-aware infrastructure has been configured, even if it may not be able to produce a non-null TimeZone at the moment.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/i18n/TimeZoneAwareLocaleContext.html
AbstractApplicationContext	A										<section class="prog__container">Abstract implementation of the ApplicationContext interface. Doesn't mandate the type of storage used for configuration; simply implements common context functionality. Uses the Template Method design pattern, requiring concrete subclasses to implement abstract methods. In contrast to a plain BeanFactory, an ApplicationContext is supposed to detect special beans defined in its internal bean factory: Therefore, this class automatically registers BeanFactoryPostProcessors, BeanPostProcessors and ApplicationListeners which are defined as beans in the context. A MessageSource may also be supplied as a bean in the context, with the name "messageSource"; otherwise, message resolution is delegated to the parent context. Furthermore, a multicaster for application events can be supplied as "applicationEventMulticaster" bean of type ApplicationEventMulticaster in the context; otherwise, a default multicaster of type SimpleApplicationEventMulticaster will be used. Implements resource loading through extending DefaultResourceLoader. Consequently treats non-URL resource paths as class path resources (supporting full class path resource names that include the package path, e.g. "mypackage/myresource.dat"), unless the DefaultResourceLoader.getResourceByPath(java.lang.String) method is overwritten in a subclass.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/support/AbstractApplicationContext.html
AbstractMessageSource	A										<section class="prog__container">Abstract implementation of the HierarchicalMessageSource interface, implementing common handling of message variants, making it easy to implement a specific strategy for a concrete MessageSource. Subclasses must implement the abstract resolveCode(java.lang.String, java.util.Locale) method. For efficient resolution of messages without arguments, the resolveCodeWithoutArguments(java.lang.String, java.util.Locale) method should be overridden as well, resolving messages without a MessageFormat being involved. Note: By default, message texts are only parsed through MessageFormat if arguments have been passed in for the message. In case of no arguments, message texts will be returned as-is. As a consequence, you should only use MessageFormat escaping for messages with actual arguments, and keep all other messages unescaped. If you prefer to escape all messages, set the "alwaysUseMessageFormat" flag to "true". Supports not only MessageSourceResolvables as primary messages but also resolution of message arguments that are in turn MessageSourceResolvables themselves. This class does not implement caching of messages per code, thus subclasses can dynamically change messages over time. Subclasses are encouraged to cache their messages in a modification-aware fashion, allowing for hot deployment of updated messages.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/support/AbstractMessageSource.html
AbstractRefreshableApplicationContext	A										<section class="prog__container">Base class for ApplicationContext implementations which are supposed to support multiple calls to AbstractApplicationContext.refresh(), creating a new internal bean factory instance every time. Typically (but not necessarily), such a context will be driven by a set of config locations to load bean definitions from. The only method to be implemented by subclasses is loadBeanDefinitions(org.springframework.beans.factory.support.DefaultListableBeanFactory), which gets invoked on each refresh. A concrete implementation is supposed to load bean definitions into the given DefaultListableBeanFactory, typically delegating to one or more specific bean definition readers. Note that there is a similar base class for WebApplicationContexts.AbstractRefreshableWebApplicationContext provides the same subclassing strategy, but additionally pre-implements all context functionality for web environments. There is also a pre-defined way to receive config locations for a web context. Concrete standalone subclasses of this base class, reading in a specific bean definition format, are ClassPathXmlApplicationContext and FileSystemXmlApplicationContext, which both derive from the common AbstractXmlApplicationContext base class; AnnotationConfigApplicationContext supports @Configuration-annotated classes as a source of bean definitions.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/support/AbstractRefreshableApplicationContext.html
AbstractRefreshableConfigApplicationContext	A										<section class="prog__container">AbstractRefreshableApplicationContext subclass that adds common handling of specified config locations. Serves as base class for XML-based application context implementations such as ClassPathXmlApplicationContext and FileSystemXmlApplicationContext, as well as XmlWebApplicationContext and XmlPortletApplicationContext.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/support/AbstractRefreshableConfigApplicationContext.html
AbstractResourceBasedMessageSource	A										<section class="prog__container">Abstract base class for MessageSource implementations based on resource bundle conventions, such as ResourceBundleMessageSource and ReloadableResourceBundleMessageSource. Provides common configuration methods and corresponding semantic definitions.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/support/AbstractResourceBasedMessageSource.html
AbstractXmlApplicationContext	A										<section class="prog__container">Convenient base class for ApplicationContext implementations, drawing configuration from XML documents containing bean definitions understood by an XmlBeanDefinitionReader. Subclasses just have to implement the getConfigResources() and/or the AbstractRefreshableConfigApplicationContext.getConfigLocations() method. Furthermore, they might override the DefaultResourceLoader.getResourceByPath(java.lang.String) hook to interpret relative paths in an environment-specific fashion, and/or AbstractApplicationContext.getResourcePatternResolver() for extended pattern resolution.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/support/AbstractXmlApplicationContext.html
ApplicationObjectSupport	A										<section class="prog__container">Convenient superclass for application objects that want to be aware of the application context, e.g. for custom lookup of collaborating beans or for context-specific resource access. It saves the application context reference and provides an initialization callback method. Furthermore, it offers numerous convenience methods for message lookup. There is no requirement to subclass this class: It just makes things a little easier if you need access to the context, e.g. for access to file resources or to the message source. Note that many application objects do not need to be aware of the application context at all, as they can receive collaborating beans via bean references. Many framework classes are derived from this class, particularly within the web support.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/support/ApplicationObjectSupport.html
ClassPathXmlApplicationContext	A										<section class="prog__container">Standalone XML application context, taking the context definition files from the class path, interpreting plain paths as class path resource names that include the package path (e.g. "mypackage/myresource.txt"). Useful for test harnesses as well as for application contexts embedded within JARs. The config location defaults can be overridden via AbstractRefreshableConfigApplicationContext.getConfigLocations(), Config locations can either denote concrete files like "/myfiles/context.xml" or Ant-style patterns like "/myfiles/*-context.xml" (see the AntPathMatcher javadoc for pattern details). Note: In case of multiple config locations, later bean definitions will override ones defined in earlier loaded files. This can be leveraged to deliberately override certain bean definitions via an extra XML file. This is a simple, one-stop shop convenience ApplicationContext. Consider using the GenericApplicationContext class in combination with an XmlBeanDefinitionReader for more flexible context setup.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/support/ClassPathXmlApplicationContext.html
ConversionServiceFactoryBean	A										<section class="prog__container">A factory providing convenient access to a ConversionService configured with converters appropriate for most environments. Set the "converters" property to supplement the default converters. This implementation creates a DefaultConversionService. Subclasses may override createConversionService() in order to return a GenericConversionService instance of their choosing. Like all FactoryBean implementations, this class is suitable for use when configuring a Spring application context using Spring <beans> XML. When configuring the container with @Configuration classes, simply instantiate, configure and return the appropriate ConversionService object from a @Bean method.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/support/ConversionServiceFactoryBean.html
DefaultLifecycleProcessor	A										<section class="prog__container">Default implementation of the LifecycleProcessor strategy.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/support/DefaultLifecycleProcessor.html
DefaultMessageSourceResolvable	A										<section class="prog__container">Default implementation of the MessageSourceResolvable interface. Offers an easy way to store all the necessary values needed to resolve a message via a MessageSource.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/support/DefaultMessageSourceResolvable.html
DelegatingMessageSource	A										<section class="prog__container">Empty MessageSource that delegates all calls to the parent MessageSource. If no parent is available, it simply won't resolve any message. Used as placeholder by AbstractApplicationContext, if the context doesn't define its own MessageSource. Not intended for direct use in applications.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/support/DelegatingMessageSource.html
EmbeddedValueResolutionSupport	A										<section class="prog__container">Convenient base class for components with a need for embedded value resolution (i.e. EmbeddedValueResolverAware consumers).</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/support/EmbeddedValueResolutionSupport.html
FileSystemXmlApplicationContext	A										<section class="prog__container">Standalone XML application context, taking the context definition files from the file system or from URLs, interpreting plain paths as relative file system locations (e.g. "mydir/myfile.txt"). Useful for test harnesses as well as for standalone environments. NOTE: Plain paths will always be interpreted as relative to the current VM working directory, even if they start with a slash. (This is consistent with the semantics in a Servlet container.) Use an explicit "file:" prefix to enforce an absolute file path.The config location defaults can be overridden via AbstractRefreshableConfigApplicationContext.getConfigLocations(), Config locations can either denote concrete files like "/myfiles/context.xml" or Ant-style patterns like "/myfiles/*-context.xml" (see the AntPathMatcher javadoc for pattern details). Note: In case of multiple config locations, later bean definitions will override ones defined in earlier loaded files. This can be leveraged to deliberately override certain bean definitions via an extra XML file. This is a simple, one-stop shop convenience ApplicationContext. Consider using the GenericApplicationContext class in combination with an XmlBeanDefinitionReader for more flexible context setup.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/support/FileSystemXmlApplicationContext.html
GenericApplicationContext	A										<section class="prog__container">Generic ApplicationContext implementation that holds a single internal DefaultListableBeanFactory instance and does not assume a specific bean definition format. Implements the BeanDefinitionRegistry interface in order to allow for applying any bean definition readers to it. Typical usage is to register a variety of bean definitions via the BeanDefinitionRegistry interface and then call AbstractApplicationContext.refresh() to initialize those beans with application context semantics (handling ApplicationContextAware, auto-detecting BeanFactoryPostProcessors, etc). In contrast to other ApplicationContext implementations that create a new internal BeanFactory instance for each refresh, the internal BeanFactory of this context is available right from the start, to be able to register bean definitions on it. AbstractApplicationContext.refresh() may only be called once. Usage example:  GenericApplicationContext ctx = new GenericApplicationContext(); XmlBeanDefinitionReader xmlReader = new XmlBeanDefinitionReader(ctx); xmlReader.loadBeanDefinitions(new ClassPathResource("applicationContext.xml")); PropertiesBeanDefinitionReader propReader = new PropertiesBeanDefinitionReader(ctx); propReader.loadBeanDefinitions(new ClassPathResource("otherBeans.properties")); ctx.refresh(); MyBean myBean = (MyBean) ctx.getBean("myBean"); ... For the typical case of XML bean definitions, simply use ClassPathXmlApplicationContext or FileSystemXmlApplicationContext, which are easier to set up - but less flexible, since you can just use standard resource locations for XML bean definitions, rather than mixing arbitrary bean definition formats. The equivalent in a web environment is XmlWebApplicationContext. For custom application context implementations that are supposed to read special bean definition formats in a refreshable manner, consider deriving from the AbstractRefreshableApplicationContext base class.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/support/GenericApplicationContext.html
GenericGroovyApplicationContext	A										<section class="prog__container">An ApplicationContext implementation that extends GenericApplicationContext and implements GroovyObject such that beans can be retrieved with the dot de-reference syntax instead of using AbstractApplicationContext.getBean(java.lang.String). Consider this as the equivalent of GenericXmlApplicationContext for Groovy bean definitions, or even an upgrade thereof since it seamlessly understands XML bean definition files as well. The main difference is that, within a Groovy script, the context can be used with an inline bean definition closure as follows:  import org.hibernate.SessionFactory import org.apache.commons.dbcp.BasicDataSource def context = new GenericGroovyApplicationContext() context.reader.beans {     dataSource(BasicDataSource) {                  // <--- invokeMethod         driverClassName = "org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver"         url = "jdbc:hsqldb:mem:grailsDB"         username = "sa"                            // <-- setProperty         password = ""         settings = [mynew:"setting"]     }     sessionFactory(SessionFactory) {         dataSource = dataSource                    // <-- getProperty for retrieving references     }     myService(MyService) {         nestedBean = { AnotherBean bean ->         // <-- setProperty with closure for nested bean             dataSource = dataSource         }     } } context.refresh() Alternatively, load a Groovy bean definition script like the following from an external resource (e.g. an "applicationContext.groovy" file):  import org.hibernate.SessionFactory import org.apache.commons.dbcp.BasicDataSource beans {     dataSource(BasicDataSource) {         driverClassName = "org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver"         url = "jdbc:hsqldb:mem:grailsDB"         username = "sa"         password = ""         settings = [mynew:"setting"]     }     sessionFactory(SessionFactory) {         dataSource = dataSource     }     myService(MyService) {         nestedBean = { AnotherBean bean ->             dataSource = dataSource         }     } } With the following Java code creating the GenericGroovyApplicationContext (potentially using Ant-style '*'/'**' location patterns):  GenericGroovyApplicationContext context = new GenericGroovyApplicationContext(); context.load("org/myapp/applicationContext.groovy"); context.refresh(); Or even more concise, provided that no extra configuration is needed:  ApplicationContext context = new GenericGroovyApplicationContext("org/myapp/applicationContext.groovy"); This application context also understands XML bean definition files, allowing for seamless mixing and matching with Groovy bean definition files. ".xml" files will be parsed as XML content; all other kinds of resources will be parsed as Groovy scripts.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/support/GenericGroovyApplicationContext.html
GenericXmlApplicationContext	A										<section class="prog__container">Convenient application context with built-in XML support. This is a flexible alternative to ClassPathXmlApplicationContext and FileSystemXmlApplicationContext, to be configured via setters, with an eventual AbstractApplicationContext.refresh() call activating the context. In case of multiple configuration files, bean definitions in later files will override those defined in earlier files. This can be leveraged to deliberately override certain bean definitions via an extra configuration file.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/support/GenericXmlApplicationContext.html
LiveBeansView	A										<section class="prog__container">Adapter for live beans view exposure, building a snapshot of current beans and their dependencies from either a local ApplicationContext (with a local LiveBeansView bean definition) or all registered ApplicationContexts (driven by the "spring.liveBeansView.mbeanDomain" environment property). Note: This feature is still in beta and primarily designed for use with Spring Tool Suite 3.1 and higher.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/support/LiveBeansView.html
LiveBeansViewMBean	A										<section class="prog__container">MBean operation interface for the LiveBeansView feature.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/support/LiveBeansViewMBean.html
MessageSourceAccessor	A										<section class="prog__container">Helper class for easy access to messages from a MessageSource, providing various overloaded getMessage methods. Available from ApplicationObjectSupport, but also reusable as a standalone helper to delegate to in application objects.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/support/MessageSourceAccessor.html
MessageSourceResourceBundle	A										<section class="prog__container">Helper class that allows for accessing a Spring MessageSource as a ResourceBundle. Used for example to expose a Spring MessageSource to JSTL web views.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/support/MessageSourceResourceBundle.html
MessageSourceSupport	A										<section class="prog__container">Base class for message source implementations, providing support infrastructure such as MessageFormat handling but not implementing concrete methods defined in the MessageSource. AbstractMessageSource derives from this class, providing concrete getMessage implementations that delegate to a central template method for message code resolution.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/support/MessageSourceSupport.html
PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer	A										<section class="prog__container">Specialization of PlaceholderConfigurerSupport that resolves ${...} placeholders within bean definition property values and @Value annotations against the current Spring Environment and its set of PropertySources. This class is designed as a general replacement for PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer in Spring 3.1 applications. It is used by default to support the property-placeholder element in working against the spring-context-3.1 XSD, whereas spring-context versions <= 3.0 default to PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer to ensure backward compatibility. See the spring-context XSD documentation for complete details. Any local properties (e.g. those added via PropertiesLoaderSupport.setProperties(java.util.Properties), PropertiesLoaderSupport.setLocations(org.springframework.core.io.Resource...) et al.) are added as a PropertySource. Search precedence of local properties is based on the value of the localOverride property, which is by default false meaning that local properties are to be searched last, after all environment property sources. See ConfigurableEnvironment and related javadocs for details on manipulating environment property sources.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/support/PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer.html
ReloadableResourceBundleMessageSource	A										<section class="prog__container">Spring-specific MessageSource implementation that accesses resource bundles using specified basenames, participating in the Spring ApplicationContext's resource loading. In contrast to the JDK-based ResourceBundleMessageSource, this class uses Properties instances as its custom data structure for messages, loading them via a PropertiesPersister strategy from Spring Resource handles. This strategy is not only capable of reloading files based on timestamp changes, but also of loading properties files with a specific character encoding. It will detect XML property files as well. Note that the basenames set as "basenames" property are treated in a slightly different fashion than the "basenames" property of ResourceBundleMessageSource. It follows the basic ResourceBundle rule of not specifying file extension or language codes, but can refer to any Spring resource location (instead of being restricted to classpath resources). With a "classpath:" prefix, resources can still be loaded from the classpath, but "cacheSeconds" values other than "-1" (caching forever) might not work reliably in this case. For a typical web application, message files could be placed in WEB-INF: e.g. a "WEB-INF/messages" basename would find a "WEB-INF/messages.properties", "WEB-INF/messages_en.properties" etc arrangement as well as "WEB-INF/messages.xml", "WEB-INF/messages_en.xml" etc. Note that message definitions in a previous resource bundle will override ones in a later bundle, due to sequential lookup. This MessageSource can easily be used outside of an ApplicationContext: it will use a DefaultResourceLoader as default, simply getting overridden with the ApplicationContext's resource loader if running in a context. It does not have any other specific dependencies. Thanks to Thomas Achleitner for providing the initial implementation of this message source!</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/support/ReloadableResourceBundleMessageSource.html
ReloadableResourceBundleMessageSource.PropertiesHolder	A										<section class="prog__container">PropertiesHolder for caching. Stores the last-modified timestamp of the source file for efficient change detection, and the timestamp of the last refresh attempt (updated every time the cache entry gets re-validated).</section>	No URL found
ResourceBundleMessageSource	A										<section class="prog__container">MessageSource implementation that accesses resource bundles using specified basenames. This class relies on the underlying JDK's ResourceBundle implementation, in combination with the JDK's standard message parsing provided by MessageFormat. This MessageSource caches both the accessed ResourceBundle instances and the generated MessageFormats for each message. It also implements rendering of no-arg messages without MessageFormat, as supported by the AbstractMessageSource base class. The caching provided by this MessageSource is significantly faster than the built-in caching of the java.util.ResourceBundle class. The basenames follow ResourceBundle conventions: essentially, a fully-qualified classpath location. If it doesn't contain a package qualifier (such as org.mypackage), it will be resolved from the classpath root. Note that the JDK's standard ResourceBundle treats dots as package separators: This means that "test.theme" is effectively equivalent to "test/theme".</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/support/ResourceBundleMessageSource.html
SimpleThreadScope	A										<section class="prog__container">A simple thread-backed Scope implementation. NOTE: This thread scope is not registered by default in common contexts. Instead, you need to explicitly assign it to a scope key in your setup, either through ConfigurableBeanFactory.registerScope(java.lang.String, org.springframework.beans.factory.config.Scope) or through a CustomScopeConfigurer bean. SimpleThreadScope does not clean up any objects associated with it. As such, it is typically preferable to use RequestScope in web environments. For an implementation of a thread-based Scope with support for destruction callbacks, refer to the   Spring by Example Custom Thread Scope Module. Thanks to Eugene Kuleshov for submitting the original prototype for a thread scope!</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/support/SimpleThreadScope.html
StaticApplicationContext	A										<section class="prog__container">ApplicationContext implementation which supports programmatic registration of beans and messages, rather than reading bean definitions from external configuration sources. Mainly useful for testing.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/support/StaticApplicationContext.html
StaticMessageSource	A										<section class="prog__container">Simple implementation of MessageSource which allows messages to be registered programmatically. This MessageSource supports basic internationalization.

AspectJWeavingEnabler	A										<section class="prog__container">Post-processor that registers AspectJ's ClassPreProcessorAgentAdapter with the Spring application context's default LoadTimeWeaver.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/weaving/AspectJWeavingEnabler.html
DefaultContextLoadTimeWeaver	A										<section class="prog__container">Default LoadTimeWeaver bean for use in an application context, decorating an automatically detected internal LoadTimeWeaver. Typically registered for the default bean name "loadTimeWeaver"; the most convenient way to achieve this is Spring's <context:load-time-weaver> XML tag. This class implements a runtime environment check for obtaining the appropriate weaver implementation: As of Spring 4.0, it detects Oracle WebLogic 10, GlassFish 3, Tomcat 6, 7 and 8, JBoss AS 5, 6 and 7, IBM WebSphere 7 and 8, Spring's VM agent, and any ClassLoader supported by Spring's ReflectiveLoadTimeWeaver.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/weaving/DefaultContextLoadTimeWeaver.html
LoadTimeWeaverAware	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface to be implemented by any object that wishes to be notified of the application context's default LoadTimeWeaver.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/weaving/LoadTimeWeaverAware.html
LoadTimeWeaverAwareProcessor	A										<section class="prog__container">BeanPostProcessor implementation that passes the context's default LoadTimeWeaver to beans that implement the LoadTimeWeaverAware interface. Application contexts will automatically register this with their underlying bean factory, provided that a default LoadTimeWeaver is actually available.

Serializable if subclasses and all attribute values are Serializable.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/AttributeAccessorSupport.html
BridgeMethodResolver	A										<section class="prog__container">Helper for resolving synthetic bridge Methods to the Method being bridged. Given a synthetic bridge Method returns the Method being bridged. A bridge method may be created by the compiler when extending a parameterized type whose methods have parameterized arguments. During runtime invocation the bridge Method may be invoked and/or used via reflection. When attempting to locate annotations on Methods, it is wise to check for bridge Methods as appropriate and find the bridged Method. See  The Java Language Specification for more details on the use of bridge methods.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/BridgeMethodResolver.html

Constants	A										<section class="prog__container">This class can be used to parse other classes containing constant definitions in public static final members. The asXXXX methods of this class allow these constant values to be accessed via their string names. Consider class Foo containing public final static int CONSTANT1 = 66; An instance of this class wrapping Foo.class will return the constant value of 66 from its asNumber method given the argument "CONSTANT1". This class is ideal for use in PropertyEditors, enabling them to recognize the same names as the constants themselves, and freeing them from maintaining their own mapping.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/Constants.html
ControlFlow	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface to be implemented by objects that can return information about the current call stack.

DecoratingProxy	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface to be implemented by decorating proxies, in particular Spring AOP proxies but potentially also custom proxies with decorator semantics. Note that this interface should just be implemented if the decorated class is not within the hierarchy of the proxy class to begin with. In particular, a "target-class" proxy such as a Spring AOP CGLIB proxy should not implement it since any lookup on the target class can simply be performed on the proxy class there anyway. Defined in the core module in order to allow #AnnotationAwareOrderComparator (and potential other candidates without spring-aop dependencies) to use it for introspection purposes, in particular annotation lookups.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/DecoratingProxy.html
DefaultParameterNameDiscoverer	A										<section class="prog__container">Default implementation of the ParameterNameDiscoverer strategy interface, using the Java 8 standard reflection mechanism (if available), and falling back to the ASM-based LocalVariableTableParameterNameDiscoverer for checking debug information in the class file.

InfrastructureProxy	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface to be implemented by transparent resource proxies that need to be considered as equal to the underlying resource, for example for consistent lookup key comparisons. Note that this interface does imply such special semantics and does not constitute a general-purpose mixin! Such wrappers will automatically be unwrapped for key comparisons in TransactionSynchronizationManager. Only fully transparent proxies, e.g. for redirection or service lookups, are supposed to implement this interface. Proxies that decorate the target object with new behavior, such as AOP proxies, do not qualify here!</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/InfrastructureProxy.html

LocalVariableTableParameterNameDiscoverer	A										<section class="prog__container">Implementation of ParameterNameDiscoverer that uses the LocalVariableTable information in the method attributes to discover parameter names. Returns null if the class file was compiled without debug information. Uses ObjectWeb's ASM library for analyzing class files. Each discoverer instance caches the ASM discovered information for each introspected Class, in a thread-safe manner. It is recommended to reuse ParameterNameDiscoverer instances as far as possible.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/LocalVariableTableParameterNameDiscoverer.html

NestedCheckedException	A										<section class="prog__container">Handy class for wrapping checked Exceptions with a root cause. This class is abstract to force the programmer to extend the class. getMessage will include nested exception information; printStackTrace and other like methods will delegate to the wrapped exception, if any. The similarity between this class and the NestedRuntimeException class is unavoidable, as Java forces these two classes to have different superclasses (ah, the inflexibility of concrete inheritance!).</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/NestedCheckedException.html
NestedExceptionUtils	A										<section class="prog__container">Helper class for implementing exception classes which are capable of holding nested exceptions.

NestedIOException	A										<section class="prog__container">Subclass of IOException that properly handles a root cause, exposing the root cause just like NestedChecked/RuntimeException does. Proper root cause handling has not been added to standard IOException before Java 6, which is why we need to do it ourselves for Java 5 compatibility purposes.

OrderComparator	A										<section class="prog__container">Comparator implementation for Ordered objects, sorting by order value ascending, respectively by priority descending. Same Order ObjectsObjects that have the same order value will be sorted with arbitrary ordering with respect to other objects with the same order value. Non-ordered ObjectsAny object that does not provide its own order value is implicitly assigned a value of Ordered.LOWEST_PRECEDENCE, thus ending up at the end of a sorted collection in arbitrary order with respect to other objects with the same order value.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/OrderComparator.html

Ordered	A										<section class="prog__container">Ordered is an interface that can be implemented by objects that should be orderable, for example in a Collection. The actual order can be interpreted as prioritization, with the first object (with the lowest order value) having the highest priority. Note that there is also a priority marker for this interface: PriorityOrdered. Order values expressed by PriorityOrdered objects always apply before same order values expressed by plainOrdered objects. Consult the Javadoc for OrderComparator for details on the sort semantics for non-ordered objects.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/Ordered.html
OverridingClassLoader	A										<section class="prog__container">ClassLoader that does not always delegate to the parent loader as normal class loaders do. This enables, for example, instrumentation to be forced in the overriding ClassLoader, or a "throwaway" class loading behavior where selected application classes are temporarily loaded in the overriding ClassLoader for introspection purposes before eventually loading an instrumented version of the class in the given parent ClassLoader.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/OverridingClassLoader.html
ParameterizedTypeReference	A										<section class="prog__container">The purpose of this class is to enable capturing and passing a generic Type. In order to capture the generic type and retain it at runtime, you need to create a subclass as follows:  ParameterizedTypeReference<List<String>> typeRef = new ParameterizedTypeReference<List<String>>() {}; The resulting typeReference instance can then be used to obtain a Type instance that carries parameterized type information. For more information on "super type tokens" see the link to Neal Gafter's blog post.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/ParameterizedTypeReference.html
ParameterNameDiscoverer	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface to discover parameter names for methods and constructors. Parameter name discovery is not always possible, but various strategies are available to try, such as looking for debug information that may have been emitted at compile time, and looking for argname annotation values optionally accompanying AspectJ annotated methods.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/ParameterNameDiscoverer.html
PrioritizedParameterNameDiscoverer	A										<section class="prog__container">ParameterNameDiscoverer implementation that tries several ParameterNameDiscoverers in succession. Those added first in the addDiscoverer method have highest priority. If one returns null, the next will be tried. The default behavior is always to return null if no discoverer matches.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/PrioritizedParameterNameDiscoverer.html
PriorityOrdered	A										<section class="prog__container">Extension of the Ordered interface, expressing a priority ordering: order values expressed by PriorityOrdered objects always apply before same order values expressed by plainOrdered objects. This is primarily a special-purpose interface, used for objects where it is particularly important to recognize prioritized objects first, without even obtaining the remaining objects. A typical example: prioritized post-processors in a Spring ApplicationContext. Note: PriorityOrdered post-processor beans are initialized in a special phase, ahead of other post-processor beans. This subtly affects their autowiring behavior: they will only be autowired against beans which do not require eager initialization for type matching.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/PriorityOrdered.html
ResolvableType	A										<section class="prog__container">Encapsulates a Java Type, providing access to supertypes, interfaces, and generic parameters along with the ability to ultimately resolve to a Class. ResolvableTypes may be obtained from fields, method parameters, method returns or classes. Most methods on this class will themselves return ResolvableTypes, allowing easy navigation. For example:  private HashMap<Integer, List<String>> myMap; public void example() {     ResolvableType t = ResolvableType.forField(getClass().getDeclaredField("myMap"));     t.getSuperType(); // AbstractMap<Integer, List<String>>     t.asMap(); // Map<Integer, List<String>>     t.getGeneric(0).resolve(); // Integer     t.getGeneric(1).resolve(); // List     t.getGeneric(1); // List<String>     t.resolveGeneric(1, 0); // String } </section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/ResolvableType.html
ResolvableTypeProvider	A										<section class="prog__container">Any object can implement this interface to provide its actual ResolvableType. Such information is very useful when figuring out if the instance matches a generic signature as Java does not convey the signature at runtime. Users of this interface should be careful in complex hierarchy scenarios, especially when the generic type signature of the class changes in sub-classes. It is always possible to return null to fallback on a default behaviour.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/ResolvableTypeProvider.html
SimpleAliasRegistry	A										<section class="prog__container">Simple implementation of the AliasRegistry interface. Serves as base class for BeanDefinitionRegistry implementations.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/SimpleAliasRegistry.html
SmartClassLoader	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface to be implemented by a reloading-aware ClassLoader (e.g. a Groovy-based ClassLoader). Detected for example by Spring's CGLIB proxy factory for making a caching decision. If a ClassLoader does not implement this interface, then all of the classes obtained from it should be considered as not reloadable (i.e. cacheable).</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/SmartClassLoader.html
SpringProperties	A										<section class="prog__container">Static holder for local Spring properties, i.e. defined at the Spring library level. Reads a spring.properties file from the root of the Spring library classpath, and also allows for programmatically setting properties through setProperty(java.lang.String, java.lang.String). When checking a property, local entries are being checked first, then falling back to JVM-level system properties through a System.getProperty(java.lang.String) check. This is an alternative way to set Spring-related system properties such as "spring.getenv.ignore" and "spring.beaninfo.ignore", in particular for scenarios where JVM system properties are locked on the target platform (e.g. WebSphere). See setFlag(java.lang.String) for a convenient way to locally set such flags to "true".</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/SpringProperties.html
SpringVersion	A										<section class="prog__container">Class that exposes the Spring version. Fetches the "Implementation-Version" manifest attribute from the jar file. Note that some ClassLoaders do not expose the package metadata, hence this class might not be able to determine the Spring version in all environments. Consider using a reflection-based check instead: For example, checking for the presence of a specific Spring 2.0 method that you intend to call.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/SpringVersion.html
StandardReflectionParameterNameDiscoverer	A										<section class="prog__container">ParameterNameDiscoverer implementation which uses JDK 8's reflection facilities for introspecting parameter names (based on the "-parameters" compiler flag).</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/StandardReflectionParameterNameDiscoverer.html
AliasFor	A										<section class="prog__container">@AliasFor is an annotation that is used to declare aliases for annotation attributes. Usage ScenariosExplicit aliases within an annotation: within a single annotation, @AliasFor can be declared on a pair of attributes to signal that they are interchangeable aliases for each other.Explicit alias for attribute in meta-annotation: if the annotation() attribute of @AliasFor is set to a different annotation than the one that declares it, the attribute() is interpreted as an alias for an attribute in a meta-annotation (i.e., an explicit meta-annotation attribute override). This enables fine-grained control over exactly which attributes are overridden within an annotation hierarchy. In fact, with @AliasFor it is even possible to declare an alias for the value attribute of a meta-annotation.Implicit aliases within an annotation: if one or more attributes within an annotation are declared as attribute overrides for the same meta-annotation attribute (either directly or transitively), those attributes will be treated as a set of implicit aliases for each other, resulting in behavior analogous to that for explicit aliases within an annotation.Usage RequirementsLike with any annotation in Java, the mere presence of @AliasFor on its own will not enforce alias semantics. For alias semantics to be enforced, annotations must be loaded via the utility methods in AnnotationUtils. Behind the scenes, Spring will synthesize an annotation by wrapping it in a dynamic proxy that transparently enforces attribute alias semantics for annotation attributes that are annotated with @AliasFor. Similarly, AnnotatedElementUtils supports explicit meta-annotation attribute overrides when @AliasFor is used within an annotation hierarchy. Typically you will not need to manually synthesize annotations on your own since Spring will do that for you transparently when looking up annotations on Spring-managed components. Implementation RequirementsExplicit aliases within an annotation: Each attribute that makes up an aliased pair must be annotated with @AliasFor, and either attribute() or value() must reference the other attribute in the pair.Aliased attributes must declare the same return type.Aliased attributes must declare a default value.Aliased attributes must declare the same default value.annotation() should not be declared.Explicit alias for attribute in meta-annotation: The attribute that is an alias for an attribute in a meta-annotation must be annotated with @AliasFor, and attribute() must reference the attribute in the meta-annotation.Aliased attributes must declare the same return type.annotation() must reference the meta-annotation.The referenced meta-annotation must be meta-present on the annotation class that declares @AliasFor.Implicit aliases within an annotation: Each attribute that belongs to a set of implicit aliases must be annotated with @AliasFor, and attribute() must reference the same attribute in the same meta-annotation (either directly or transitively via other explicit meta-annotation attribute overrides within the annotation hierarchy).Aliased attributes must declare the same return type.Aliased attributes must declare a default value.Aliased attributes must declare the same default value.annotation() must reference an appropriate meta-annotation.The referenced meta-annotation must be meta-present on the annotation class that declares @AliasFor.Example: Explicit Aliases within an AnnotationIn @ContextConfiguration, value and locations are explicit aliases for each other.  public @interface ContextConfiguration {    @AliasFor("locations")    String[] value() default {};    @AliasFor("value")    String[] locations() default {};    // ... }Example: Explicit Alias for Attribute in Meta-annotationIn @XmlTestConfig, xmlFiles is an explicit alias for locations in @ContextConfiguration. In other words, xmlFiles overrides the locations attribute in @ContextConfiguration.  @ContextConfiguration public @interface XmlTestConfig {    @AliasFor(annotation = ContextConfiguration.class, attribute = "locations")    String[] xmlFiles(); }Example: Implicit Aliases within an AnnotationIn @MyTestConfig, value, groovyScripts, and xmlFiles are all explicit meta-annotation attribute overrides for the locations attribute in @ContextConfiguration. These three attributes are therefore also implicit aliases for each other.  @ContextConfiguration public @interface MyTestConfig {    @AliasFor(annotation = ContextConfiguration.class, attribute = "locations")    String[] value() default {};    @AliasFor(annotation = ContextConfiguration.class, attribute = "locations")    String[] groovyScripts() default {};    @AliasFor(annotation = ContextConfiguration.class, attribute = "locations")    String[] xmlFiles() default {}; }Example: Transitive Implicit Aliases within an AnnotationIn @GroovyOrXmlTestConfig, groovy is an explicit override for the groovyScripts attribute in @MyTestConfig; whereas, xml is an explicit override for the locations attribute in @ContextConfiguration. Furthermore, groovy and xml are transitive implicit aliases for each other, since they both effectively override the locations attribute in @ContextConfiguration.  @MyTestConfig public @interface GroovyOrXmlTestConfig {    @AliasFor(annotation = MyTestConfig.class, attribute = "groovyScripts")    String[] groovy() default {};    @AliasFor(annotation = ContextConfiguration.class, attribute = "locations")    String[] xml() default {}; }Spring Annotations Supporting Attribute AliasesAs of Spring Framework 4.2, several annotations within core Spring have been updated to use @AliasFor to configure their internal attribute aliases. Consult the Javadoc for individual annotations as well as the reference manual for details.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/annotation/AliasFor.html
AnnotatedElementUtils	A										<section class="prog__container">General utility methods for finding annotations, meta-annotations, and repeatable annotations on AnnotatedElements. AnnotatedElementUtils defines the public API for Spring's meta-annotation programming model with support for annotation attribute overrides. If you do not need support for annotation attribute overrides, consider using AnnotationUtils instead. Note that the features of this class are not provided by the JDK's introspection facilities themselves. Annotation Attribute OverridesSupport for meta-annotations with attribute overrides in composed annotations is provided by all variants of the getMergedAnnotationAttributes(), getMergedAnnotation(), getAllMergedAnnotations(), getMergedRepeatableAnnotations(), findMergedAnnotationAttributes(), findMergedAnnotation(), findAllMergedAnnotations(), and findMergedRepeatableAnnotations() methods. Find vs. Get SemanticsThe search algorithms used by methods in this class follow either find or get semantics. Consult the javadocs for each individual method for details on which search algorithm is used. Get semantics are limited to searching for annotations that are either present on an AnnotatedElement (i.e., declared locally or inherited) or declared within the annotation hierarchy above the AnnotatedElement. Find semantics are much more exhaustive, providing get semantics plus support for the following: Searching on interfaces, if the annotated element is a class Searching on superclasses, if the annotated element is a class Resolving bridged methods, if the annotated element is a method Searching on methods in interfaces, if the annotated element is a method Searching on methods in superclasses, if the annotated element is a method Support for @InheritedMethods following get semantics will honor the contract of Java's @Inherited annotation except that locally declared annotations (including custom composed annotations) will be favored over inherited annotations. In contrast, methods following find semantics will completely ignore the presence of @Inherited since the find search algorithm manually traverses type and method hierarchies and thereby implicitly supports annotation inheritance without the need for @Inherited.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/annotation/AnnotatedElementUtils.html
AnnotationAttributes	A										<section class="prog__container">LinkedHashMap subclass representing annotation attribute key-value pairs as read by AnnotationUtils, AnnotatedElementUtils, and Spring's reflection- and ASM-based AnnotationMetadata implementations. Provides 'pseudo-reification' to avoid noisy Map generics in the calling code as well as convenience methods for looking up annotation attributes in a type-safe fashion.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/annotation/AnnotationAttributes.html
AnnotationAwareOrderComparator	A										<section class="prog__container">AnnotationAwareOrderComparator is an extension of OrderComparator that supports Spring's Ordered interface as well as the @Order and @Priority annotations, with an order value provided by an Ordered instance overriding a statically defined annotation value (if any). Consult the Javadoc for OrderComparator for details on the sort semantics for non-ordered objects.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/annotation/AnnotationAwareOrderComparator.html
AnnotationConfigurationException	A										<section class="prog__container">Thrown by AnnotationUtils and synthesized annotations if an annotation is improperly configured.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/annotation/AnnotationConfigurationException.html
AnnotationUtils	A										<section class="prog__container">General utility methods for working with annotations, handling meta-annotations, bridge methods (which the compiler generates for generic declarations) as well as super methods (for optional annotation inheritance). Note that most of the features of this class are not provided by the JDK's introspection facilities themselves. As a general rule for runtime-retained annotations (e.g. for transaction control, authorization, or service exposure), always use the lookup methods on this class (e.g., findAnnotation(Method, Class), getAnnotation(Method, Class), and getAnnotations(Method)) instead of the plain annotation lookup methods in the JDK. You can still explicitly choose between a get lookup on the given class level only (getAnnotation(Method, Class)) and a find lookup in the entire inheritance hierarchy of the given method (findAnnotation(Method, Class)). Terminology The terms directly present, indirectly present, and present have the same meanings as defined in the class-level Javadoc for AnnotatedElement (in Java 8). An annotation is meta-present on an element if the annotation is declared as a meta-annotation on some other annotation which is present on the element. Annotation A is meta-present on another annotation if A is either directly present or meta-present on the other annotation. Meta-annotation SupportMost find*() methods and some get*() methods in this class provide support for finding annotations used as meta-annotations. Consult the javadoc for each method in this class for details. For fine-grained support for meta-annotations with attribute overrides in composed annotations, consider using AnnotatedElementUtils's more specific methods instead. Attribute AliasesAll public methods in this class that return annotations, arrays of annotations, or AnnotationAttributes transparently support attribute aliases configured via @AliasFor. Consult the various synthesizeAnnotation*(..) methods for details. Search ScopeThe search algorithms used by methods in this class stop searching for an annotation once the first annotation of the specified type has been found. As a consequence, additional annotations of the specified type will be silently ignored.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/annotation/AnnotationUtils.html
Order	A										<section class="prog__container">@Order defines the sort order for an annotated component. The value() is optional and represents an order value as defined in the Ordered interface. Lower values have higher priority. The default value is Ordered.LOWEST_PRECEDENCE, indicating lowest priority (losing to any other specified order value). Since Spring 4.1, the standard Priority annotation can be used as a drop-in replacement for this annotation. NOTE: Annotation-based ordering is supported for specific kinds of components only — for example, for annotation-based AspectJ aspects. Ordering strategies within the Spring container, on the other hand, are typically based on the Ordered interface in order to allow for programmatically configurable ordering of each instance. Consult the Javadoc for OrderComparator for details on the sort semantics for non-ordered objects.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/annotation/Order.html

Often used to selectively match custom conversion logic based on the presence of a field or class-level characteristic, such as an annotation or method. For example, when converting from a String field to a Date field, an implementation might return true if the target field has also been annotated with @DateTimeFormat. As another example, when converting from a String field to an Account field, an implementation might return true if the target Account class defines a public static findAccount(String) method.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/convert/converter/ConditionalConverter.html

This is the most flexible of the Converter SPI interfaces, but also the most complex. It is flexible in that a GenericConverter may support converting between multiple source/target type pairs (see getConvertibleTypes(). In addition, GenericConverter implementations have access to source/target field context during the type conversion process. This allows for resolving source and target field metadata such as annotations and generics information, which can be used to influence the conversion logic.

GenericConversionService	A										<section class="prog__container">Base ConversionService implementation suitable for use in most environments. Indirectly implements ConverterRegistry as registration API through the ConfigurableConversionService interface.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/convert/support/GenericConversionService.html
AbstractEnvironment	A										<section class="prog__container">Abstract base class for Environment implementations. Supports the notion of reserved default profile names and enables specifying active and default profiles through the ACTIVE_PROFILES_PROPERTY_NAME and DEFAULT_PROFILES_PROPERTY_NAME properties. Concrete subclasses differ primarily on which PropertySource objects they add by default. AbstractEnvironment adds none. Subclasses should contribute property sources through the protected customizePropertySources(MutablePropertySources) hook, while clients should customize using ConfigurableEnvironment.getPropertySources() and working against the MutablePropertySources API. See ConfigurableEnvironment javadoc for usage examples.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/env/AbstractEnvironment.html
AbstractPropertyResolver	A										<section class="prog__container">Abstract base class for resolving properties against any underlying source.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/env/AbstractPropertyResolver.html
CommandLinePropertySource	A										<section class="prog__container">Abstract base class for PropertySource implementations backed by command line arguments. The parameterized type T represents the underlying source of command line options. This may be as simple as a String array in the case of SimpleCommandLinePropertySource, or specific to a particular API such as JOpt's OptionSet in the case of JOptCommandLinePropertySource. Purpose and General Usage For use in standalone Spring-based applications, i.e. those that are bootstrapped via a traditional main method accepting a String[] of arguments from the command line. In many cases, processing command-line arguments directly within the main method may be sufficient, but in other cases, it may be desirable to inject arguments as values into Spring beans. It is this latter set of cases in which a CommandLinePropertySource becomes useful. A CommandLinePropertySource will typically be added to the Environment of the Spring ApplicationContext, at which point all command line arguments become available through the PropertyResolver.getProperty(String) family of methods. For example:  public static void main(String[] args) {     CommandLinePropertySource clps = ...;     AnnotationConfigApplicationContext ctx = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext();     ctx.getEnvironment().getPropertySources().addFirst(clps);     ctx.register(AppConfig.class);     ctx.refresh(); } With the bootstrap logic above, the AppConfig class may @Inject the Spring Environment and query it directly for properties:  @Configuration public class AppConfig {     @Inject Environment env;     @Bean     public void DataSource dataSource() {         MyVendorDataSource dataSource = new MyVendorDataSource();         dataSource.setHostname(env.getProperty("db.hostname", "localhost"));         dataSource.setUsername(env.getRequiredProperty("db.username"));         dataSource.setPassword(env.getRequiredProperty("db.password"));         // ...         return dataSource;     } } Because the CommandLinePropertySource was added to the Environment's set of MutablePropertySources using the #addFirst method, it has highest search precedence, meaning that while "db.hostname" and other properties may exist in other property sources such as the system environment variables, it will be chosen from the command line property source first. This is a reasonable approach given that arguments specified on the command line are naturally more specific than those specified as environment variables. As an alternative to injecting the Environment, Spring's @Value annotation may be used to inject these properties, given that a PropertySourcesPropertyResolver bean has been registered, either directly or through using the <context:property-placeholder> element. For example:  @Component public class MyComponent {     @Value("my.property:defaultVal")     private String myProperty;     public void getMyProperty() {         return this.myProperty;     }     // ... }Working with option argumentsIndividual command line arguments are represented as properties through the usual PropertySource.getProperty(String) and PropertySource.containsProperty(String) methods. For example, given the following command line: --o1=v1 --o2 'o1' and 'o2' are treated as "option arguments", and the following assertions would evaluate true:  CommandLinePropertySource ps = ... assert ps.containsProperty("o1") == true; assert ps.containsProperty("o2") == true; assert ps.containsProperty("o3") == false; assert ps.getProperty("o1").equals("v1"); assert ps.getProperty("o2").equals(""); assert ps.getProperty("o3") == null;  Note that the 'o2' option has no argument, but getProperty("o2") resolves to empty string ("") as opposed to null, while getProperty("o3") resolves to null because it was not specified. This behavior is consistent with the general contract to be followed by all PropertySource implementations. Note also that while "--" was used in the examples above to denote an option argument, this syntax may vary across individual command line argument libraries. For example, a JOpt- or Commons CLI-based implementation may allow for single dash ("-") "short" option arguments, etc. Working with non-option argumentsNon-option arguments are also supported through this abstraction. Any arguments supplied without an option-style prefix such as "-" or "--" are considered "non-option arguments" and available through the special "nonOptionArgs" property.  If multiple non-option arguments are specified, the value of this property will be a comma-delimited string containing all of the arguments. This approach ensures a simple and consistent return type (String) for all properties from a CommandLinePropertySource and at the same time lends itself to conversion when used in conjunction with the Spring Environment and its built-in ConversionService. Consider the following example: --o1=v1 --o2=v2 /path/to/file1 /path/to/file2 In this example, "o1" and "o2" would be considered "option arguments", while the two filesystem paths qualify as "non-option arguments".  As such, the following assertions will evaluate true:  CommandLinePropertySource ps = ... assert ps.containsProperty("o1") == true; assert ps.containsProperty("o2") == true; assert ps.containsProperty("nonOptionArgs") == true; assert ps.getProperty("o1").equals("v1"); assert ps.getProperty("o2").equals("v2"); assert ps.getProperty("nonOptionArgs").equals("/path/to/file1,/path/to/file2"); As mentioned above, when used in conjunction with the Spring Environment abstraction, this comma-delimited string may easily be converted to a String array or list:  Environment env = applicationContext.getEnvironment(); String[] nonOptionArgs = env.getProperty("nonOptionArgs", String[].class); assert nonOptionArgs[0].equals("/path/to/file1"); assert nonOptionArgs[1].equals("/path/to/file2"); The name of the special "non-option arguments" property may be customized through the setNonOptionArgsPropertyName(String) method. Doing so is recommended as it gives proper semantic value to non-option arguments. For example, if filesystem paths are being specified as non-option arguments, it is likely preferable to refer to these as something like "file.locations" than the default of "nonOptionArgs":  public static void main(String[] args) {     CommandLinePropertySource clps = ...;     clps.setNonOptionArgsPropertyName("file.locations");     AnnotationConfigApplicationContext ctx = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext();     ctx.getEnvironment().getPropertySources().addFirst(clps);     ctx.register(AppConfig.class);     ctx.refresh(); }Limitations This abstraction is not intended to expose the full power of underlying command line parsing APIs such as JOpt or Commons CLI. It's intent is rather just the opposite: to provide the simplest possible abstraction for accessing command line arguments after they have been parsed. So the typical case will involve fully configuring the underlying command line parsing API, parsing the String[] of arguments coming into the main method, and then simply providing the parsing results to an implementation of CommandLinePropertySource. At that point, all arguments can be considered either 'option' or 'non-option' arguments and as described above can be accessed through the normal PropertySource and Environment APIs.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/env/CommandLinePropertySource.html
CompositePropertySource	A										<section class="prog__container">Composite PropertySource implementation that iterates over a set of PropertySource instances. Necessary in cases where multiple property sources share the same name, e.g. when multiple values are supplied to @PropertySource. As of Spring 4.1.2, this class extends EnumerablePropertySource instead of plain PropertySource, exposing getPropertyNames() based on the accumulated property names from all contained sources (as far as possible).</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/env/CompositePropertySource.html
ConfigurableEnvironment	A										<section class="prog__container">Configuration interface to be implemented by most if not all Environment types. Provides facilities for setting active and default profiles and manipulating underlying property sources. Allows clients to set and validate required properties, customize the conversion service and more through the ConfigurablePropertyResolver superinterface. Manipulating property sourcesProperty sources may be removed, reordered, or replaced; and additional property sources may be added using the MutablePropertySources instance returned from getPropertySources(). The following examples are against the StandardEnvironment implementation of ConfigurableEnvironment, but are generally applicable to any implementation, though particular default property sources may differ. Example: adding a new property source with highest search priority   ConfigurableEnvironment environment = new StandardEnvironment();   MutablePropertySources propertySources = environment.getPropertySources();   Map myMap = new HashMap();   myMap.put("xyz", "myValue");   propertySources.addFirst(new MapPropertySource("MY_MAP", myMap)); Example: removing the default system properties property source   MutablePropertySources propertySources = environment.getPropertySources();   propertySources.remove(StandardEnvironment.SYSTEM_PROPERTIES_PROPERTY_SOURCE_NAME) Example: mocking the system environment for testing purposes   MutablePropertySources propertySources = environment.getPropertySources();   MockPropertySource mockEnvVars = new MockPropertySource().withProperty("xyz", "myValue");   propertySources.replace(StandardEnvironment.SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PROPERTY_SOURCE_NAME, mockEnvVars);  When an Environment is being used by an ApplicationContext, it is important that any such PropertySource manipulations be performed before the context's refresh() method is called. This ensures that all property sources are available during the container bootstrap process, including use by property placeholder configurers.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/env/ConfigurableEnvironment.html
ConfigurablePropertyResolver	A										<section class="prog__container">Configuration interface to be implemented by most if not all PropertyResolver types. Provides facilities for accessing and customizing the ConversionService used when converting property values from one type to another.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/env/ConfigurablePropertyResolver.html
EnumerablePropertySource	A										<section class="prog__container">A PropertySource implementation capable of interrogating its underlying source object to enumerate all possible property name/value pairs. Exposes the getPropertyNames() method to allow callers to introspect available properties without having to access the underlying source object. This also facilitates a more efficient implementation of containsProperty(String), in that it can call getPropertyNames() and iterate through the returned array rather than attempting a call to PropertySource.getProperty(String) which may be more expensive. Implementations may consider caching the result of getPropertyNames() to fully exploit this performance opportunity. Most framework-provided PropertySource implementations are enumerable; a counter-example would be JndiPropertySource where, due to the nature of JNDI it is not possible to determine all possible property names at any given time; rather it is only possible to try to access a property (via PropertySource.getProperty(String)) in order to evaluate whether it is present or not.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/env/EnumerablePropertySource.html
Environment	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface representing the environment in which the current application is running. Models two key aspects of the application environment: profiles and properties. Methods related to property access are exposed via the PropertyResolver superinterface. A profile is a named, logical group of bean definitions to be registered with the container only if the given profile is active. Beans may be assigned to a profile whether defined in XML or via annotations; see the spring-beans 3.1 schema or the @Profile annotation for syntax details. The role of the Environment object with relation to profiles is in determining which profiles (if any) are currently active, and which profiles (if any) should be active by default. Properties play an important role in almost all applications, and may originate from a variety of sources: properties files, JVM system properties, system environment variables, JNDI, servlet context parameters, ad-hoc Properties objects, Maps, and so on. The role of the environment object with relation to properties is to provide the user with a convenient service interface for configuring property sources and resolving properties from them. Beans managed within an ApplicationContext may register to be EnvironmentAware or @Inject the Environment in order to query profile state or resolve properties directly. In most cases, however, application-level beans should not need to interact with the Environment directly but instead may have to have ${...} property values replaced by a property placeholder configurer such as PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer, which itself is EnvironmentAware and as of Spring 3.1 is registered by default when using <context:property-placeholder/>. Configuration of the environment object must be done through the ConfigurableEnvironment interface, returned from all AbstractApplicationContext subclass getEnvironment() methods. See ConfigurableEnvironment Javadoc for usage examples demonstrating manipulation of property sources prior to application context refresh().</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/env/Environment.html
EnvironmentCapable	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface indicating a component that contains and exposes an Environment reference. All Spring application contexts are EnvironmentCapable, and the interface is used primarily for performing instanceof checks in framework methods that accept BeanFactory instances that may or may not actually be ApplicationContext instances in order to interact with the environment if indeed it is available. As mentioned, ApplicationContext extends EnvironmentCapable, and thus exposes a getEnvironment() method; however, ConfigurableApplicationContext redefines getEnvironment() and narrows the signature to return a ConfigurableEnvironment. The effect is that an Environment object is 'read-only' until it is being accessed from a ConfigurableApplicationContext, at which point it too may be configured.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/env/EnvironmentCapable.html
JOptCommandLinePropertySource	A										<section class="prog__container">CommandLinePropertySource implementation backed by a JOpt OptionSet. Typical usage Configure and execute an OptionParser against the String[] of arguments supplied to the main method, and create a JOptCommandLinePropertySource using the resulting OptionSet object:  public static void main(String[] args) {     OptionParser parser = new OptionParser();     parser.accepts("option1");     parser.accepts("option2").withRequiredArg();     OptionSet options = parser.parse(args);     PropertySource ps = new JOptCommandLinePropertySource(options);     // ... } See CommandLinePropertySource for complete general usage examples. Requires JOpt version 4.3 or higher. Tested against JOpt up until 4.6.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/env/JOptCommandLinePropertySource.html
MapPropertySource	A										<section class="prog__container">PropertySource that reads keys and values from a Map object.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/env/MapPropertySource.html
MissingRequiredPropertiesException	A										<section class="prog__container">Exception thrown when required properties are not found.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/env/MissingRequiredPropertiesException.html
MutablePropertySources	A										<section class="prog__container">Default implementation of the PropertySources interface. Allows manipulation of contained property sources and provides a constructor for copying an existing PropertySources instance. Where precedence is mentioned in methods such as addFirst(org.springframework.core.env.PropertySource<?>) and addLast(org.springframework.core.env.PropertySource<?>), this is with regard to the order in which property sources will be searched when resolving a given property with a PropertyResolver.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/env/MutablePropertySources.html
PropertiesPropertySource	A										<section class="prog__container">PropertySource implementation that extracts properties from a Properties object. Note that because a Properties object is technically an <Object, Object> Hashtable, one may contain non-String keys or values. This implementation, however is restricted to accessing only String-based keys and values, in the same fashion as Properties.getProperty(java.lang.String) and Properties.setProperty(java.lang.String, java.lang.String).</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/env/PropertiesPropertySource.html
PropertyResolver	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface for resolving properties against any underlying source.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/env/PropertyResolver.html
PropertySource	A										<section class="prog__container">Abstract base class representing a source of name/value property pairs. The underlying source object may be of any type T that encapsulates properties. Examples include Properties objects, Map objects, ServletContext and ServletConfig objects (for access to init parameters). Explore the PropertySource type hierarchy to see provided implementations. PropertySource objects are not typically used in isolation, but rather through a PropertySources object, which aggregates property sources and in conjunction with a PropertyResolver implementation that can perform precedence-based searches across the set of PropertySources. PropertySource identity is determined not based on the content of encapsulated properties, but rather based on the name of the PropertySource alone. This is useful for manipulating PropertySource objects when in collection contexts. See operations in MutablePropertySources as well as the named(String) and toString() methods for details. Note that when working with @Configuration classes that the @PropertySource annotation provides a convenient and declarative way of adding property sources to the enclosing Environment.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/env/PropertySource.html
PropertySource.StubPropertySource	A										<section class="prog__container">PropertySource to be used as a placeholder in cases where an actual property source cannot be eagerly initialized at application context creation time.  For example, a ServletContext-based property source must wait until the ServletContext object is available to its enclosing ApplicationContext.  In such cases, a stub should be used to hold the intended default position/order of the property source, then be replaced during context refresh.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/env/PropertySource.StubPropertySource.html
PropertySources	A										<section class="prog__container">Holder containing one or more PropertySource objects.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/env/PropertySources.html

SimpleCommandLinePropertySource	A										<section class="prog__container">CommandLinePropertySource implementation backed by a simple String array. Purpose This CommandLinePropertySource implementation aims to provide the simplest possible approach to parsing command line arguments.  As with all CommandLinePropertySource implementations, command line arguments are broken into two distinct groups: option arguments and non-option arguments, as described below (some sections copied from Javadoc for SimpleCommandLineArgsParser): Working with option arguments Option arguments must adhere to the exact syntax: --optName[=optValue] That is, options must be prefixed with "--", and may or may not specify a value. If a value is specified, the name and value must be separated without spaces by an equals sign ("="). Valid examples of option arguments --foo --foo=bar --foo="bar then baz" --foo=bar,baz,bizInvalid examples of option arguments -foo --foo bar --foo = bar --foo=bar --foo=baz --foo=bizWorking with non-option arguments Any and all arguments specified at the command line without the "--" option prefix will be considered as "non-option arguments" and made available through the getNonOptionArgs() method. Typical usage public static void main(String[] args) {     PropertySource ps = new SimpleCommandLinePropertySource(args);     // ... } See CommandLinePropertySource for complete general usage examples. Beyond the basicsWhen more fully-featured command line parsing is necessary, consider using the provided JOptCommandLinePropertySource, or implement your own CommandLinePropertySource against the command line parsing library of your choice!</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/env/SimpleCommandLinePropertySource.html
StandardEnvironment	A										<section class="prog__container">Environment implementation suitable for use in 'standard' (i.e. non-web) applications. In addition to the usual functions of a ConfigurableEnvironment such as property resolution and profile-related operations, this implementation configures two default property sources, to be searched in the following order: system propertiessystem environment variables That is, if the key "xyz" is present both in the JVM system properties as well as in the set of environment variables for the current process, the value of key "xyz" from system properties will return from a call to environment.getProperty("xyz"). This ordering is chosen by default because system properties are per-JVM, while environment variables may be the same across many JVMs on a given system.  Giving system properties precedence allows for overriding of environment variables on a per-JVM basis. These default property sources may be removed, reordered, or replaced; and additional property sources may be added using the MutablePropertySources instance available from AbstractEnvironment.getPropertySources(). See ConfigurableEnvironment Javadoc for usage examples. See SystemEnvironmentPropertySource javadoc for details on special handling of property names in shell environments (e.g. Bash) that disallow period characters in variable names.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/env/StandardEnvironment.html
SystemEnvironmentPropertySource	A										<section class="prog__container">Specialization of MapPropertySource designed for use with system environment variables. Compensates for constraints in Bash and other shells that do not allow for variables containing the period character and/or hyphen character; also allows for uppercase variations on property names for more idiomatic shell use. For example, a call to getProperty("foo.bar") will attempt to find a value for the original property or any 'equivalent' property, returning the first found: foo.bar - the original namefoo_bar - with underscores for periods (if any)FOO.BAR - original, with upper caseFOO_BAR - with underscores and upper case Any hyphen variant of the above would work as well, or even mix dot/hyphen variants. The same applies for calls to containsProperty(String), which returns true if any of the above properties are present, otherwise false. This feature is particularly useful when specifying active or default profiles as environment variables. The following is not allowable under Bash: spring.profiles.active=p1 java -classpath ... MyApp However, the following syntax is permitted and is also more conventional: SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=p1 java -classpath ... MyAppEnable debug- or trace-level logging for this class (or package) for messages explaining when these 'property name resolutions' occur. This property source is included by default in StandardEnvironment and all its subclasses.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/env/SystemEnvironmentPropertySource.html
AbstractFileResolvingResource	A										<section class="prog__container">Abstract base class for resources which resolve URLs into File references, such as UrlResource or ClassPathResource. Detects the "file" protocol as well as the JBoss "vfs" protocol in URLs, resolving file system references accordingly.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/io/AbstractFileResolvingResource.html
AbstractResource	A										<section class="prog__container">Convenience base class for Resource implementations, pre-implementing typical behavior. The "exists" method will check whether a File or InputStream can be opened; "isOpen" will always return false; "getURL" and "getFile" throw an exception; and "toString" will return the description.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/io/AbstractResource.html
ByteArrayResource	A										<section class="prog__container">Resource implementation for a given byte array. Creates a ByteArrayInputStream for the given byte array. Useful for loading content from any given byte array, without having to resort to a single-use InputStreamResource. Particularly useful for creating mail attachments from local content, where JavaMail needs to be able to read the stream multiple times.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/io/ByteArrayResource.html
ClassPathResource	A										<section class="prog__container">Resource implementation for class path resources. Uses either a given ClassLoader or a given Class for loading resources. Supports resolution as java.io.File if the class path resource resides in the file system, but not for resources in a JAR. Always supports resolution as URL.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/io/ClassPathResource.html

ContextResource	A										<section class="prog__container">Extended interface for a resource that is loaded from an enclosing 'context', e.g. from a ServletContext or a PortletContext but also from plain classpath paths or relative file system paths (specified without an explicit prefix, hence applying relative to the local ResourceLoader's context).</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/io/ContextResource.html

DefaultResourceLoader	A										<section class="prog__container">Default implementation of the ResourceLoader interface. Used by ResourceEditor, and serves as base class for AbstractApplicationContext. Can also be used standalone. Will return a UrlResource if the location value is a URL, and a ClassPathResource if it is a non-URL path or a "classpath:" pseudo-URL.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/io/DefaultResourceLoader.html
DescriptiveResource	A										<section class="prog__container">Simple Resource implementation that holds a resource description but does not point to an actually readable resource. To be used as placeholder if a Resource argument is expected by an API but not necessarily used for actual reading.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/io/DescriptiveResource.html
FileSystemResource	A										<section class="prog__container">Resource implementation for java.io.File handles. Supports resolution as a File and also as a URL. Implements the extended WritableResource interface.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/io/FileSystemResource.html
FileSystemResourceLoader	A										<section class="prog__container">ResourceLoader implementation that resolves plain paths as file system resources rather than as class path resources (the latter is DefaultResourceLoader's default strategy). NOTE: Plain paths will always be interpreted as relative to the current VM working directory, even if they start with a slash. (This is consistent with the semantics in a Servlet container.) Use an explicit "file:" prefix to enforce an absolute file path.FileSystemXmlApplicationContext is a full-fledged ApplicationContext implementation that provides the same resource path resolution strategy.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/io/FileSystemResourceLoader.html
InputStreamResource	A										<section class="prog__container">Resource implementation for a given InputStream. Should only be used if no other specific Resource implementation is applicable. In particular, prefer ByteArrayResource or any of the file-based Resource implementations where possible. In contrast to other Resource implementations, this is a descriptor for an already opened resource - therefore returning true from isOpen(). Do not use an InputStreamResource if you need to keep the resource descriptor somewhere, or if you need to read from a stream multiple times.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/io/InputStreamResource.html
InputStreamSource	A										<section class="prog__container">Simple interface for objects that are sources for an InputStream. This is the base interface for Spring's more extensive Resource interface. For single-use streams, InputStreamResource can be used for any given InputStream. Spring's ByteArrayResource or any file-based Resource implementation can be used as a concrete instance, allowing one to read the underlying content stream multiple times. This makes this interface useful as an abstract content source for mail attachments, for example.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/io/InputStreamSource.html
PathResource	A										<section class="prog__container">Resource implementation for java.nio.file.Path handles. Supports resolution as File, and also as URL.

Used as an SPI for DefaultResourceLoader, allowing for custom protocols to be handled without subclassing the loader implementation (or application context implementation).</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/io/ProtocolResolver.html
Resource	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface for a resource descriptor that abstracts from the actual type of underlying resource, such as a file or class path resource. An InputStream can be opened for every resource if it exists in physical form, but a URL or File handle can just be returned for certain resources. The actual behavior is implementation-specific.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/io/Resource.html
ResourceEditor	A										<section class="prog__container">Editor for Resource descriptors, to automatically convert String locations e.g. file:C:/myfile.txt or classpath:myfile.txt to Resource properties instead of using a String location property. The path may contain ${...} placeholders, to be resolved as Environment properties: e.g. ${user.dir}. Unresolvable placeholders are ignored by default. Delegates to a ResourceLoader to do the heavy lifting, by default using a DefaultResourceLoader.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/io/ResourceEditor.html
ResourceLoader	A										<section class="prog__container">Strategy interface for loading resources (e.. class path or file system resources). An ApplicationContext is required to provide this functionality, plus extended ResourcePatternResolver support. DefaultResourceLoader is a standalone implementation that is usable outside an ApplicationContext, also used by ResourceEditor. Bean properties of type Resource and Resource array can be populated from Strings when running in an ApplicationContext, using the particular context's resource loading strategy.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/io/ResourceLoader.html

PathMatchingResourcePatternResolver	A										<section class="prog__container">A ResourcePatternResolver implementation that is able to resolve a specified resource location path into one or more matching Resources. The source path may be a simple path which has a one-to-one mapping to a target Resource, or alternatively may contain the special "classpath*:" prefix and/or internal Ant-style regular expressions (matched using Spring's AntPathMatcher utility). Both of the latter are effectively wildcards. No Wildcards:In the simple case, if the specified location path does not start with the "classpath*:" prefix, and does not contain a PathMatcher pattern, this resolver will simply return a single resource via a getResource() call on the underlying ResourceLoader. Examples are real URLs such as "file:C:/context.xml", pseudo-URLs such as "classpath:/context.xml", and simple unprefixed paths such as "/WEB-INF/context.xml". The latter will resolve in a fashion specific to the underlying ResourceLoader (e.g. ServletContextResource for a WebApplicationContext). Ant-style Patterns:When the path location contains an Ant-style pattern, e.g.:  /WEB-INF/*-context.xml com/mycompany/**/applicationContext.xml file:C:/some/path/*-context.xml classpath:com/mycompany/**/applicationContext.xml the resolver follows a more complex but defined procedure to try to resolve the wildcard. It produces a Resource for the path up to the last non-wildcard segment and obtains a URL from it. If this URL is not a "jar:" URL or container-specific variant (e.g. "zip:" in WebLogic, "wsjar" in WebSphere", etc.), then a java.io.File is obtained from it, and used to resolve the wildcard by walking the filesystem. In the case of a jar URL, the resolver either gets a java.net.JarURLConnection from it, or manually parses the jar URL, and then traverses the contents of the jar file, to resolve the wildcards. Implications on portability:If the specified path is already a file URL (either explicitly, or implicitly because the base ResourceLoader is a filesystem one, then wildcarding is guaranteed to work in a completely portable fashion. If the specified path is a classpath location, then the resolver must obtain the last non-wildcard path segment URL via a Classloader.getResource() call. Since this is just a node of the path (not the file at the end) it is actually undefined (in the ClassLoader Javadocs) exactly what sort of a URL is returned in this case. In practice, it is usually a java.io.File representing the directory, where the classpath resource resolves to a filesystem location, or a jar URL of some sort, where the classpath resource resolves to a jar location. Still, there is a portability concern on this operation. If a jar URL is obtained for the last non-wildcard segment, the resolver must be able to get a java.net.JarURLConnection from it, or manually parse the jar URL, to be able to walk the contents of the jar, and resolve the wildcard. This will work in most environments, but will fail in others, and it is strongly recommended that the wildcard resolution of resources coming from jars be thoroughly tested in your specific environment before you rely on it. classpath*: Prefix:There is special support for retrieving multiple class path resources with the same name, via the "classpath*:" prefix. For example, "classpath*:META-INF/beans.xml" will find all "beans.xml" files in the class path, be it in "classes" directories or in JAR files. This is particularly useful for autodetecting config files of the same name at the same location within each jar file. Internally, this happens via a ClassLoader.getResources() call, and is completely portable. The "classpath*:" prefix can also be combined with a PathMatcher pattern in the rest of the location path, for example "classpath*:META-INF/*-beans.xml". In this case, the resolution strategy is fairly simple: a ClassLoader.getResources() call is used on the last non-wildcard path segment to get all the matching resources in the class loader hierarchy, and then off each resource the same PathMatcher resolution strategy described above is used for the wildcard subpath. Other notes:WARNING: Note that "classpath*:" when combined with Ant-style patterns will only work reliably with at least one root directory before the pattern starts, unless the actual target files reside in the file system. This means that a pattern like "classpath*:*.xml" will not retrieve files from the root of jar files but rather only from the root of expanded directories. This originates from a limitation in the JDK's ClassLoader.getResources() method which only returns file system locations for a passed-in empty String (indicating potential roots to search). This ResourcePatternResolver implementation is trying to mitigate the jar root lookup limitation through URLClassLoader introspection and "java.class.path" manifest evaluation; however, without portability guarantees. WARNING: Ant-style patterns with "classpath:" resources are not guaranteed to find matching resources if the root package to search is available in multiple class path locations. This is because a resource such as      com/mycompany/package1/service-context.xml  may be in only one location, but when a path such as      classpath:com/mycompany/**/service-context.xml  is used to try to resolve it, the resolver will work off the (first) URL returned by getResource("com/mycompany");. If this base package node exists in multiple classloader locations, the actual end resource may not be underneath. Therefore, preferably, use "classpath*:" with the same Ant-style pattern in such a case, which will search all class path locations that contain the root package.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/io/support/PathMatchingResourcePatternResolver.html

Can also translate a collection or array of location patterns into a merged Resource array. A path may contain ${...} placeholders, to be resolved as Environment properties: e.g. ${user.dir}. Unresolvable placeholders are ignored by default. Delegates to a ResourcePatternResolver, by default using a PathMatchingResourcePatternResolver.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/io/support/ResourceArrayPropertyEditor.html
ResourcePatternResolver	A										<section class="prog__container">Strategy interface for resolving a location pattern (for example, an Ant-style path pattern) into Resource objects. This is an extension to the ResourceLoader interface. A passed-in ResourceLoader (for example, an ApplicationContext passed in via ResourceLoaderAware when running in a context) can be checked whether it implements this extended interface too. PathMatchingResourcePatternResolver is a standalone implementation that is usable outside an ApplicationContext, also used by ResourceArrayPropertyEditor for populating Resource array bean properties. Can be used with any sort of location pattern (e.g. "/WEB-INF/*-context.xml"): Input patterns have to match the strategy implementation. This interface just specifies the conversion method rather than a specific pattern format. This interface also suggests a new resource prefix "classpath*:" for all matching resources from the class path. Note that the resource location is expected to be a path without placeholders in this case (e.g. "/beans.xml"); JAR files or classes directories can contain multiple files of the same name.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/io/support/ResourcePatternResolver.html

Note: The Executors class includes a set of methods that can convert some other common closure-like objects, for example, PrivilegedAction to Callable before executing them. Implementing this interface also indicates that the TaskExecutor.execute(Runnable) method will not execute its Runnable in the caller's thread but rather asynchronously in some other thread.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/task/AsyncTaskExecutor.html
SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor	A										<section class="prog__container">TaskExecutor implementation that fires up a new Thread for each task, executing it asynchronously. Supports limiting concurrent threads through the "concurrencyLimit" bean property. By default, the number of concurrent threads is unlimited. NOTE: This implementation does not reuse threads! Consider a thread-pooling TaskExecutor implementation instead, in particular for executing a large number of short-lived tasks.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/task/SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor.html
SyncTaskExecutor	A										<section class="prog__container">TaskExecutor implementation that executes each task synchronously in the calling thread. Mainly intended for testing scenarios. Execution in the calling thread does have the advantage of participating in it's thread context, for example the thread context class loader or the thread's current transaction association. That said, in many cases, asynchronous execution will be preferable: choose an asynchronous TaskExecutor instead for such scenarios.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/task/SyncTaskExecutor.html
TaskDecorator	A										<section class="prog__container">A callback interface for a decorator to be applied to any Runnable about to be executed. Note that such a decorator is not necessarily being applied to the user-supplied Runnable/Callable but rather to the actual execution callback (which may be a wrapper around the user-supplied task). The primary use case is to set some execution context around the task's invocation, or to provide some monitoring/statistics for task execution.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/task/TaskDecorator.html
TaskExecutor	A										<section class="prog__container">Simple task executor interface that abstracts the execution of a Runnable. Implementations can use all sorts of different execution strategies, such as: synchronous, asynchronous, using a thread pool, and more. Equivalent to JDK 1.5's Executor interface; extending it now in Spring 3.0, so that clients may declare a dependency on an Executor and receive any TaskExecutor implementation. This interface remains separate from the standard Executor interface mainly for backwards compatibility with JDK 1.4 in Spring 2.x.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/task/TaskExecutor.html

ConcurrentExecutorAdapter	A										<section class="prog__container">Adapter that exposes the Executor interface for any Spring TaskExecutor. This is less useful as of Spring 3.0, since TaskExecutor itself extends the Executor interface.

ExecutorServiceAdapter	A										<section class="prog__container">Adapter that takes a Spring TaskExecutor) and exposes a full java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService for it. This is primarily for adapting to client components that communicate via the java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService API. It can also be used as common ground between a local Spring TaskExecutor backend and a JNDI-located ManagedExecutorService in a Java EE 6 environment. NOTE: This ExecutorService adapter does not support the lifecycle methods in the java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService API ("shutdown()" etc), similar to a server-wide ManagedExecutorService in a Java EE 6 environment. The lifecycle is always up to the backend pool, with this adapter acting as an access-only proxy for that target pool.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/task/support/ExecutorServiceAdapter.html
TaskExecutorAdapter	A										<section class="prog__container">Adapter that takes a JDK java.util.concurrent.Executor and exposes a Spring TaskExecutor for it.

DataAccessException	A										<section class="prog__container">Root of the hierarchy of data access exceptions discussed in Expert One-On-One J2EE Design and Development. Please see Chapter 9 of this book for detailed discussion of the motivation for this package. This exception hierarchy aims to let user code find and handle the kind of error encountered without knowing the details of the particular data access API in use (e.g. JDBC).

Autodetects beans that implement the PersistenceExceptionTranslator interface, which are subsequently asked to translate candidate exceptions. All of Spring's applicable resource factories (e.g. LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean) implement the PersistenceExceptionTranslator interface out of the box. As a consequence, all that is usually needed to enable automatic exception translation is marking all affected beans (such as Repositories or DAOs) with the @Repository annotation, along with defining this post-processor as a bean in the application context.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/dao/annotation/PersistenceExceptionTranslationPostProcessor.html

SpringBeanAutowiringInterceptor	A										<section class="prog__container">EJB3-compliant interceptor class that injects Spring beans into fields and methods which are annotated with @Autowired. Performs injection after construction as well as after activation of a passivated bean. To be applied through an @Interceptors annotation in the EJB Session Bean or Message-Driven Bean class, or through an interceptor-binding XML element in the EJB deployment descriptor. Delegates to Spring's AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor underneath, allowing for customization of its specific settings through overriding the configureBeanPostProcessor(org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor, java.lang.Object) template method. The actual BeanFactory to obtain Spring beans from is determined by the getBeanFactory(java.lang.Object) template method. The default implementation obtains the Spring ContextSingletonBeanFactoryLocator, initialized from the default resource location classpath*:beanRefContext.xml, and obtains the single ApplicationContext defined there. NOTE: If you have more than one shared ApplicationContext definition available in your EJB class loader, you need to override the getBeanFactoryLocatorKey(java.lang.Object) method and provide a specific locator key for each autowired EJB. Alternatively, override the getBeanFactory(java.lang.Object) template method and obtain the target factory explicitly. WARNING: Do not define the same bean as Spring-managed bean and as EJB3 session bean in the same deployment unit. In particular, be careful when using the <context:component-scan> feature in combination with the deployment of Spring-based EJB3 session beans: Make sure that the EJB3 session beans are not autodetected as Spring-managed beans as well, using appropriate package restrictions.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/ejb/interceptor/SpringBeanAutowiringInterceptor.html

A resolver can optionally specify an array of target classes for which it should be called. However, if it returns null from getSpecificTargetClasses(), it will be called for all property references and given a chance to determine if it can read or write them. Property resolvers are considered to be ordered and each will be called in turn.

SpelCompiler	A										<section class="prog__container">A SpelCompiler will take a regular parsed expression and create (and load) a class containing byte code that does the same thing as that expression. The compiled form of an expression will evaluate far faster than the interpreted form. The SpelCompiler is not currently handling all expression types but covers many of the common cases. The framework is extensible to cover more cases in the future. For absolute maximum speed there is *no checking* in the compiled code. The compiled version of the expression uses information learned during interpreted runs of the expression when it generates the byte code. For example if it knows that a particular property dereference always seems to return a Map then it will generate byte code that expects the result of the property dereference to be a Map. This ensures maximal performance but should the dereference result in something other than a map, the compiled expression will fail - like a ClassCastException would occur if passing data of an unexpected type in a regular Java program. Due to the lack of checking there are likely some expressions that should never be compiled, for example if an expression is continuously dealing with different types of data. Due to these cases the compiler is something that must be selectively turned on for an associated SpelExpressionParser (through the SpelParserConfiguration object), it is not on by default. Individual expressions can be compiled by calling SpelCompiler.compile(expression).</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/expression/spel/standard/SpelCompiler.html

The reflective nature of this LoadTimeWeaver is particularly useful when the underlying ClassLoader implementation is loaded in a different class loader itself (such as the application server's class loader which is not visible to the web application). There is no direct API dependency between this LoadTimeWeaver adapter and the underlying ClassLoader, just a 'loose' method contract. This is the LoadTimeWeaver to use in combination with Spring's TomcatInstrumentableClassLoader for Tomcat 5.0+ as well as with the Resin application server version 3.1+.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/instrument/classloading/ReflectiveLoadTimeWeaver.html

CciLocalTransactionManager	A										<section class="prog__container">PlatformTransactionManager implementation that manages local transactions for a single CCI ConnectionFactory. Binds a CCI Connection from the specified ConnectionFactory to the thread, potentially allowing for one thread-bound Connection per ConnectionFactory. Application code is required to retrieve the CCI Connection via ConnectionFactoryUtils.getConnection(ConnectionFactory) instead of a standard J2EE-style ConnectionFactory.getConnection() call. Spring classes such as CciTemplate use this strategy implicitly. If not used in combination with this transaction manager, the ConnectionFactoryUtils lookup strategy behaves exactly like the native DataSource lookup; it can thus be used in a portable fashion. Alternatively, you can allow application code to work with the standard J2EE lookup pattern ConnectionFactory.getConnection(), for example for legacy code that is not aware of Spring at all. In that case, define a TransactionAwareConnectionFactoryProxy for your target ConnectionFactory, which will automatically participate in Spring-managed transactions.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jca/cci/connection/CciLocalTransactionManager.html
ConnectionFactoryUtils	A										<section class="prog__container">Helper class that provides static methods for obtaining CCI Connections from a ConnectionFactory. Includes special support for Spring-managed transactional Connections, e.g. managed by CciLocalTransactionManager or JtaTransactionManager. Used internally by CciTemplate, Spring's CCI operation objects and the CciLocalTransactionManager. Can also be used directly in application code.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jca/cci/connection/ConnectionFactoryUtils.html
ConnectionHolder	A										<section class="prog__container">Connection holder, wrapping a CCI Connection. CciLocalTransactionManager binds instances of this class to the thread, for a given ConnectionFactory. Note: This is an SPI class, not intended to be used by applications.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jca/cci/connection/ConnectionHolder.html
ConnectionSpecConnectionFactoryAdapter	A										<section class="prog__container">An adapter for a target CCI ConnectionFactory, applying the given ConnectionSpec to every standard getConnection() call, that is, implicitly invoking getConnection(ConnectionSpec) on the target. All other methods simply delegate to the corresponding methods of the target ConnectionFactory. Can be used to proxy a target JNDI ConnectionFactory that does not have a ConnectionSpec configured. Client code can work with the ConnectionFactory without passing in a ConnectionSpec on every getConnection() call. In the following example, client code can simply transparently work with the preconfigured "myConnectionFactory", implicitly accessing "myTargetConnectionFactory" with the specified user credentials.  <bean id="myTargetConnectionFactory" class="org.springframework.jndi.JndiObjectFactoryBean">   <property name="jndiName" value="java:comp/env/cci/mycf"/> </bean> <bean id="myConnectionFactory" class="org.springframework.jca.cci.connection.ConnectionSpecConnectionFactoryAdapter">   <property name="targetConnectionFactory" ref="myTargetConnectionFactory"/>   <property name="connectionSpec">     <bean class="your.resource.adapter.ConnectionSpecImpl">       <property name="username" value="myusername"/>       <property name="password" value="mypassword"/>     </bean>   </property> </bean>If the "connectionSpec" is empty, this proxy will simply delegate to the standard getConnection() method of the target ConnectionFactory. This can be used to keep a UserCredentialsConnectionFactoryAdapter bean definition just for the option of implicitly passing in a ConnectionSpec if the particular target ConnectionFactory requires it.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jca/cci/connection/ConnectionSpecConnectionFactoryAdapter.html
DelegatingConnectionFactory	A										<section class="prog__container">CCI ConnectionFactory implementation that delegates all calls to a given target ConnectionFactory. This class is meant to be subclassed, with subclasses overriding only those methods (such as getConnection()) that should not simply delegate to the target ConnectionFactory.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jca/cci/connection/DelegatingConnectionFactory.html
NotSupportedRecordFactory	A										<section class="prog__container">Implementation of the CCI RecordFactory interface that always throws NotSupportedException. Useful as a placeholder for a RecordFactory argument (for example as defined by the RecordCreator callback), in particular when the connector's ConnectionFactory.getRecordFactory() implementation happens to throw NotSupportedException early rather than throwing the exception from RecordFactory's methods.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jca/cci/connection/NotSupportedRecordFactory.html
SingleConnectionFactory	A										<section class="prog__container">A CCI ConnectionFactory adapter that returns the same Connection on all getConnection calls, and ignores calls to Connection.close(). Useful for testing and standalone environments, to keep using the same Connection for multiple CciTemplate calls, without having a pooling ConnectionFactory, also spanning any number of transactions. You can either pass in a CCI Connection directly, or let this factory lazily create a Connection via a given target ConnectionFactory.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jca/cci/connection/SingleConnectionFactory.html
TransactionAwareConnectionFactoryProxy	A										<section class="prog__container">Proxy for a target CCI ConnectionFactory, adding awareness of Spring-managed transactions. Similar to a transactional JNDI ConnectionFactory as provided by a J2EE server. Data access code that should remain unaware of Spring's data access support can work with this proxy to seamlessly participate in Spring-managed transactions. Note that the transaction manager, for example the CciLocalTransactionManager, still needs to work with underlying ConnectionFactory, not with this proxy. Make sure that TransactionAwareConnectionFactoryProxy is the outermost ConnectionFactory of a chain of ConnectionFactory proxies/adapters. TransactionAwareConnectionFactoryProxy can delegate either directly to the target connection pool or to some intermediate proxy/adapter like ConnectionSpecConnectionFactoryAdapter. Delegates to ConnectionFactoryUtils for automatically participating in thread-bound transactions, for example managed by CciLocalTransactionManager. getConnection calls and close calls on returned Connections will behave properly within a transaction, i.e. always operate on the transactional Connection. If not within a transaction, normal ConnectionFactory behavior applies. This proxy allows data access code to work with the plain JCA CCI API and still participate in Spring-managed transactions, similar to CCI code in a J2EE/JTA environment. However, if possible, use Spring's ConnectionFactoryUtils, CciTemplate or CCI operation objects to get transaction participation even without a proxy for the target ConnectionFactory, avoiding the need to define such a proxy in the first place. NOTE: This ConnectionFactory proxy needs to return wrapped Connections in order to handle close calls properly. Therefore, the returned Connections cannot be cast to a native CCI Connection type or to a connection pool implementation type.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jca/cci/connection/TransactionAwareConnectionFactoryProxy.html
CciOperations	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface that specifies a basic set of CCI operations on an EIS. Implemented by CciTemplate. Not often used, but a useful option to enhance testability, as it can easily be mocked or stubbed. Alternatively, the standard CCI infrastructure can be mocked. However, mocking this interface constitutes significantly less work.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jca/cci/core/CciOperations.html
CciTemplate	A										<section class="prog__container">This is the central class in the CCI core package. It simplifies the use of CCI and helps to avoid common errors. It executes core CCI workflow, leaving application code to provide parameters to CCI and extract results. This class executes EIS queries or updates, catching ResourceExceptions and translating them to the generic exception hierarchy defined in the org.springframework.dao package. Code using this class can pass in and receive Record instances, or alternatively implement callback interfaces for creating input Records and extracting result objects from output Records (or CCI ResultSets). Can be used within a service implementation via direct instantiation with a ConnectionFactory reference, or get prepared in an application context and given to services as bean reference. Note: The ConnectionFactory should always be configured as a bean in the application context, in the first case given to the service directly, in the second case to the prepared template.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jca/cci/core/CciTemplate.html
ConnectionCallback	A										<section class="prog__container">Generic callback interface for code that operates on a CCI Connection. Allows to execute any number of operations on a single Connection, using any type and number of Interaction. This is particularly useful for delegating to existing data access code that expects a Connection to work on and throws ResourceException. For newly written code, it is strongly recommended to use CciTemplate's more specific execute variants.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jca/cci/core/ConnectionCallback.html
InteractionCallback	A										<section class="prog__container">Generic callback interface for code that operates on a CCI Interaction. Allows to execute any number of operations on a single Interaction, for example a single execute call or repeated execute calls with varying parameters. This is particularly useful for delegating to existing data access code that expects an Interaction to work on and throws ResourceException. For newly written code, it is strongly recommended to use CciTemplate's more specific execute variants.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jca/cci/core/InteractionCallback.html
RecordCreator	A										<section class="prog__container">Callback interface for creating a CCI Record instance, usually based on the passed-in CCI RecordFactory. Used for input Record creation in CciTemplate. Alternatively, Record instances can be passed into CciTemplate's corresponding execute methods directly, either instantiated manually or created through CciTemplate's Record factory methods. Also used for creating default output Records in CciTemplate. This is useful when the JCA connector needs an explicit output Record instance, but no output Records should be passed into CciTemplate's execute methods.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jca/cci/core/RecordCreator.html
RecordExtractor	A										<section class="prog__container">Callback interface for extracting a result object from a CCI Record instance. Used for output object creation in CciTemplate. Alternatively, output Records can also be returned to client code as-is. In case of a CCI ResultSet as execution result, you will almost always want to implement a RecordExtractor, to be able to read the ResultSet in a managed fashion, with the CCI Connection still open while reading the ResultSet. Implementations of this interface perform the actual work of extracting results, but don't need to worry about exception handling. ResourceExceptions will be caught and handled correctly by the CciTemplate class.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jca/cci/core/RecordExtractor.html
CciDaoSupport	A										<section class="prog__container">Convenient super class for CCI-based data access objects. Requires a ConnectionFactory to be set, providing a CciTemplate based on it to subclasses through the getCciTemplate() method. This base class is mainly intended for CciTemplate usage but can also be used when working with a Connection directly or when using org.springframework.jca.cci.object classes.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jca/cci/core/support/CciDaoSupport.html

EisOperation	A										<section class="prog__container">Base class for EIS operation objects that work with the CCI API. Encapsulates a CCI ConnectionFactory and a CCI InteractionSpec. Works with a CciTemplate instance underneath. EIS operation objects are an alternative to working with a CciTemplate directly.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jca/cci/object/EisOperation.html

MappingRecordOperation	A										<section class="prog__container">EIS operation object that expects mapped input and output objects, converting to and from CCI Records. Concrete subclasses must implement the abstract createInputRecord(RecordFactory, Object) and extractOutputData(Record) methods, to create an input Record from an object and to convert an output Record into an object, respectively.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jca/cci/object/MappingRecordOperation.html

BootstrapContextAware	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface to be implemented by any object that wishes to be notified of the BootstrapContext (typically determined by the ResourceAdapterApplicationContext) that it runs in.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jca/context/BootstrapContextAware.html
ResourceAdapterApplicationContext	A										<section class="prog__container">ApplicationContext implementation for a JCA ResourceAdapter. Needs to be initialized with the JCA BootstrapContext, passing it on to Spring-managed beans that implement BootstrapContextAware.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jca/context/ResourceAdapterApplicationContext.html
SpringContextResourceAdapter	A										<section class="prog__container">JCA 1.5 ResourceAdapter implementation that loads a Spring ApplicationContext, starting and stopping Spring-managed beans as part of the ResourceAdapter's lifecycle. Ideal for application contexts that do not need any HTTP entry points but rather just consist of message endpoints and scheduled jobs etc. Beans in such a context may use application server resources such as the JTA transaction manager and JNDI-bound JDBC DataSources and JMS ConnectionFactory instances, and may also register with the platform's JMX server - all through Spring's standard transaction management and JNDI and JMX support facilities. If the need for scheduling asynchronous work arises, consider using Spring's WorkManagerTaskExecutor as a standard bean definition, to be injected into application beans through dependency injection. This WorkManagerTaskExecutor will automatically use the JCA WorkManager from the BootstrapContext that has been provided to this ResourceAdapter. The JCA BootstrapContext may also be accessed directly, through application components that implement the BootstrapContextAware interface. When deployed using this ResourceAdapter, the BootstrapContext is guaranteed to be passed on to such components. This ResourceAdapter is to be defined in a "META-INF/ra.xml" file within a J2EE ".rar" deployment unit like as follows:  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <connector xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee"                 xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"                 xsi:schemaLocation="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee/connector_1_5.xsd"                 version="1.5">         <vendor-name>Spring Framework</vendor-name>         <eis-type>Spring Connector</eis-type>         <resourceadapter-version>1.0</resourceadapter-version>         <resourceadapter>                 <resourceadapter-class>org.springframework.jca.context.SpringContextResourceAdapter</resourceadapter-class>                 <config-property>                         <config-property-name>ContextConfigLocation</config-property-name>                         <config-property-type>java.lang.String</config-property-type>                         <config-property-value>META-INF/applicationContext.xml</config-property-value>                 </config-property>         </resourceadapter> </connector> Note that "META-INF/applicationContext.xml" is the default context config location, so it doesn't have to specified unless you intend to specify different/additional config files. So in the default case, you may remove the entire config-property section above. For simple deployment needs, all you need to do is the following: Package all application classes into a RAR file (which is just a standard JAR file with a different file extension), add all required library jars into the root of the RAR archive, add a "META-INF/ra.xml" deployment descriptor as shown above as well as the corresponding Spring XML bean definition file(s) (typically "META-INF/applicationContext.xml"), and drop the resulting RAR file into your application server's deployment directory!</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jca/context/SpringContextResourceAdapter.html
AbstractMessageEndpointFactory.AbstractMessageEndpoint	A										<section class="prog__container">Inner class for actual endpoint implementations, based on template method to allow for any kind of concrete endpoint implementation.</section>	No URL found
AbstractMessageEndpointFactory	A										<section class="prog__container">Abstract base implementation of the JCA 1.5/1.6/1.7 MessageEndpointFactory interface, providing transaction management capabilities as well as ClassLoader exposure for endpoint invocations.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jca/endpoint/AbstractMessageEndpointFactory.html
GenericMessageEndpointFactory	A										<section class="prog__container">Generic implementation of the JCA 1.5 MessageEndpointFactory interface, providing transaction management capabilities for any kind of message listener object (e.g. MessageListener objects or MessageListener objects. Uses AOP proxies for concrete endpoint instances, simply wrapping the specified message listener object and exposing all of its implemented interfaces on the endpoint instance. Typically used with Spring's GenericMessageEndpointManager, but not tied to it. As a consequence, this endpoint factory could also be used with programmatic endpoint management on a native ResourceAdapter instance.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jca/endpoint/GenericMessageEndpointFactory.html
GenericMessageEndpointFactory.InternalResourceException	A										<section class="prog__container">Internal exception thrown when a ResourceException has been encountered during the endpoint invocation. Will only be used if the ResourceAdapter does not invoke the endpoint's beforeDelivery and afterDelivery directly, leaving it up to the concrete endpoint to apply those - and to handle any ResourceExceptions thrown from them.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jca/endpoint/GenericMessageEndpointFactory.InternalResourceException.html
GenericMessageEndpointManager	A										<section class="prog__container">Generic bean that manages JCA 1.5 message endpoints within a Spring application context, activating and deactivating the endpoint as part of the application context's lifecycle. This class is completely generic in that it may work with any ResourceAdapter, any MessageEndpointFactory, and any ActivationSpec. It can be configured in standard bean style, for example through Spring's XML bean definition format, as follows:  <bean class="org.springframework.jca.endpoint.GenericMessageEndpointManager">         <property name="resourceAdapter" ref="resourceAdapter"/>         <property name="messageEndpointFactory">     <bean class="org.springframework.jca.endpoint.GenericMessageEndpointFactory">       <property name="messageListener" ref="messageListener"/>     </bean>         </property>         <property name="activationSpec">     <bean class="org.apache.activemq.ra.ActiveMQActivationSpec">       <property name="destination" value="myQueue"/>       <property name="destinationType" value="javax.jms.Queue"/>     </bean>   </property> </bean> In this example, Spring's own GenericMessageEndpointFactory is used to point to a standard message listener object that happens to be supported by the specified target ResourceAdapter: in this case, a JMS MessageListener object as supported by the ActiveMQ message broker, defined as a Spring bean:  <bean id="messageListener" class="com.myorg.messaging.myMessageListener">   ... </bean> The target ResourceAdapter may be configured as a local Spring bean as well (the typical case) or obtained from JNDI (e.g. on WebLogic). For the example above, a local ResourceAdapter bean could be defined as follows (matching the "resourceAdapter" bean reference above):  <bean id="resourceAdapter" class="org.springframework.jca.support.ResourceAdapterFactoryBean">   <property name="resourceAdapter">     <bean class="org.apache.activemq.ra.ActiveMQResourceAdapter">       <property name="serverUrl" value="tcp://localhost:61616"/>     </bean>   </property>   <property name="workManager">     <bean class="org.springframework.jca.work.SimpleTaskWorkManager"/>   </property> </bean> For a different target resource, the configuration would simply point to a different ResourceAdapter and a different ActivationSpec object (which are both specific to the resource provider), and possibly a different message listener (e.g. a CCI MessageListener for a resource adapter which is based on the JCA Common Client Interface). The asynchronous execution strategy can be customized through the "workManager" property on the ResourceAdapterFactoryBean (as shown above). Check out SimpleTaskWorkManager's javadoc for its configuration options; alternatively, any other JCA-compliant WorkManager can be used (e.g. Geronimo's). Transactional execution is a responsibility of the concrete message endpoint, as built by the specified MessageEndpointFactory. GenericMessageEndpointFactory supports XA transaction participation through its "transactionManager" property, typically with a Spring JtaTransactionManager or a plain TransactionManager implementation specified there.  <bean class="org.springframework.jca.endpoint.GenericMessageEndpointManager">         <property name="resourceAdapter" ref="resourceAdapter"/>         <property name="messageEndpointFactory">     <bean class="org.springframework.jca.endpoint.GenericMessageEndpointFactory">       <property name="messageListener" ref="messageListener"/>       <property name="transactionManager" ref="transactionManager"/>     </bean>         </property>         <property name="activationSpec">     <bean class="org.apache.activemq.ra.ActiveMQActivationSpec">       <property name="destination" value="myQueue"/>       <property name="destinationType" value="javax.jms.Queue"/>     </bean>   </property> </bean> <bean id="transactionManager" class="org.springframework.transaction.jta.JtaTransactionManager"/> Alternatively, check out your resource provider's ActivationSpec object, which should support local transactions through a provider-specific config flag, e.g. ActiveMQActivationSpec's "useRAManagedTransaction" bean property.  <bean class="org.springframework.jca.endpoint.GenericMessageEndpointManager">         <property name="resourceAdapter" ref="resourceAdapter"/>         <property name="messageEndpointFactory">     <bean class="org.springframework.jca.endpoint.GenericMessageEndpointFactory">       <property name="messageListener" ref="messageListener"/>     </bean>         </property>         <property name="activationSpec">     <bean class="org.apache.activemq.ra.ActiveMQActivationSpec">       <property name="destination" value="myQueue"/>       <property name="destinationType" value="javax.jms.Queue"/>       <property name="useRAManagedTransaction" value="true"/>     </bean>   </property> </bean></section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jca/endpoint/GenericMessageEndpointManager.html
LocalConnectionFactoryBean	A										<section class="prog__container">FactoryBean that creates a local JCA connection factory in "non-managed" mode (as defined by the Java Connector Architecture specification). This is a direct alternative to a JndiObjectFactoryBean definition that obtains a connection factory handle from a J2EE server's naming environment. The type of the connection factory is dependent on the actual connector: the connector can either expose its native API (such as a JDBC DataSource or a JMS ConnectionFactory) or follow the standard Common Client Interface (CCI), as defined by the JCA spec. The exposed interface in the CCI case is ConnectionFactory. In order to use this FactoryBean, you must specify the connector's "managedConnectionFactory" (usually configured as separate JavaBean), which will be used to create the actual connection factory reference as exposed to the application. Optionally, you can also specify a "connectionManager", in order to use a custom ConnectionManager instead of the connector's default. NOTE: In non-managed mode, a connector is not deployed on an application server, or more specificially not interacting with an application server. Consequently, it cannot use a J2EE server's system contracts: connection management, transaction management, and security management. A custom ConnectionManager implementation has to be used for applying those services in conjunction with a standalone transaction coordinator etc. The connector will use a local ConnectionManager (included in the connector) by default, which cannot participate in global transactions due to the lack of XA enlistment. You need to specify an XA-capable ConnectionManager in order to make the connector interact with an XA transaction coordinator. Alternatively, simply use the native local transaction facilities of the exposed API (e.g. CCI local transactions), or use a corresponding implementation of Spring's PlatformTransactionManager SPI (e.g. CciLocalTransactionManager) to drive local transactions.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jca/support/LocalConnectionFactoryBean.html
ResourceAdapterFactoryBean	A										<section class="prog__container">FactoryBean that bootstraps the specified JCA 1.5 ResourceAdapter, starting it with a local BootstrapContext and exposing it for bean references. It will also stop the ResourceAdapter on context shutdown. This corresponds to 'non-managed' bootstrap in a local environment, according to the JCA 1.5 specification. This is essentially an adapter for bean-style bootstrapping of a JCA ResourceAdapter, allowing the BootstrapContext or its elements (such as the JCA WorkManager) to be specified through bean properties.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jca/support/ResourceAdapterFactoryBean.html
SimpleBootstrapContext	A										<section class="prog__container">Simple implementation of the JCA 1.5 BootstrapContext interface, used for bootstrapping a JCA ResourceAdapter in a local environment. Delegates to the given WorkManager and XATerminator, if any. Creates simple local instances of java.util.Timer.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jca/support/SimpleBootstrapContext.html
DelegatingWork	A										<section class="prog__container">Simple Work adapter that delegates to a given Runnable.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jca/work/DelegatingWork.html
SimpleTaskWorkManager	A										<section class="prog__container">Simple JCA 1.5 WorkManager implementation that delegates to a Spring TaskExecutor. Provides simple task execution including start timeouts, but without support for a JCA ExecutionContext (i.e. without support for imported transactions). Uses a SyncTaskExecutor for doWork(javax.resource.spi.work.Work) calls and a SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor for startWork(javax.resource.spi.work.Work) and scheduleWork(javax.resource.spi.work.Work) calls, by default. These default task executors can be overridden through configuration. NOTE: This WorkManager does not provide thread pooling by default! Specify a ThreadPoolTaskExecutor (or any other thread-pooling TaskExecutor) as "asyncTaskExecutor" in order to achieve actual thread pooling. This WorkManager automatically detects a specified AsyncTaskExecutor implementation and uses its extended timeout functionality where appropriate. JCA WorkListeners are fully supported in any case.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jca/work/SimpleTaskWorkManager.html
WorkManagerTaskExecutor	A										<section class="prog__container">TaskExecutor implementation that delegates to a JCA 1.5 WorkManager, implementing the WorkManager interface. This is mainly intended for use within a JCA ResourceAdapter implementation, but may also be used in a standalone environment, delegating to a locally embedded WorkManager implementation (such as Geronimo's). Also implements the JCA 1.5 WorkManager interface itself, delegating all calls to the target WorkManager. Hence, a caller can choose whether it wants to talk to this executor through the Spring TaskExecutor interface or the JCA 1.5 WorkManager interface. This adapter is also capable of obtaining a JCA WorkManager from JNDI. This is for example appropriate on the Geronimo application server, where WorkManager GBeans (e.g. Geronimo's default "DefaultWorkManager" GBean) can be linked into the J2EE environment through "gbean-ref" entries in the geronimo-web.xml deployment descriptor. On JBoss and GlassFish, obtaining the default JCA WorkManager requires special lookup steps. See the JBossWorkManagerTaskExecutorGlassFishWorkManagerTaskExecutor classes which are the direct equivalent of this generic JCA adapter class.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jca/work/WorkManagerTaskExecutor.html
GlassFishWorkManagerTaskExecutor	A										<section class="prog__container">Spring TaskExecutor adapter for the GlassFish JCA WorkManager. Can be defined in web applications to make a TaskExecutor reference available, talking to the GlassFish WorkManager (thread pool) underneath. This is the GlassFish equivalent of the CommonJ WorkManagerTaskExecutor adapter for WebLogic and WebSphere. Note: On GlassFish 4 and higher, a DefaultManagedTaskExecutor should be preferred, following JSR-236 support in Java EE 7.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jca/work/glassfish/GlassFishWorkManagerTaskExecutor.html
JBossWorkManagerTaskExecutor	A										<section class="prog__container">Deprecated. as of Spring 4.0, since there are no fully supported versions of JBoss that this class works with anymore</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jca/work/jboss/JBossWorkManagerTaskExecutor.html

BadSqlGrammarException	A										<section class="prog__container">Exception thrown when SQL specified is invalid. Such exceptions always have a java.sql.SQLException root cause. It would be possible to have subclasses for no such table, no such column etc. A custom SQLExceptionTranslator could create such more specific exceptions, without affecting code using this class.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/BadSqlGrammarException.html
CannotGetJdbcConnectionException	A										<section class="prog__container">Fatal exception thrown when we can't connect to an RDBMS using JDBC.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/CannotGetJdbcConnectionException.html
IncorrectResultSetColumnCountException	A										<section class="prog__container">Data access exception thrown when a result set did not have the correct column count, for example when expecting a single column but getting 0 or more than 1 columns.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/IncorrectResultSetColumnCountException.html
InvalidResultSetAccessException	A										<section class="prog__container">Exception thrown when a ResultSet has been accessed in an invalid fashion. Such exceptions always have a java.sql.SQLException root cause. This typically happens when an invalid ResultSet column index or name has been specified. Also thrown by disconnected SqlRowSets.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/InvalidResultSetAccessException.html
JdbcUpdateAffectedIncorrectNumberOfRowsException	A										<section class="prog__container">Exception thrown when a JDBC update affects an unexpected number of rows. Typically we expect an update to affect a single row, meaning it's an error if it affects multiple rows.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/JdbcUpdateAffectedIncorrectNumberOfRowsException.html
LobRetrievalFailureException	A										<section class="prog__container">Exception to be thrown when a LOB could not be retrieved.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/LobRetrievalFailureException.html
SQLWarningException	A										<section class="prog__container">Exception thrown when we're not ignoring SQLWarnings. If a SQLWarning is reported, the operation completed, so we will need to explicitly roll it back if we're not happy when looking at the warning. We might choose to ignore (and log) the warning, or to wrap and throw it in the shape of this SQLWarningException instead.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/SQLWarningException.html
UncategorizedSQLException	A										<section class="prog__container">Exception thrown when we can't classify a SQLException into one of our generic data access exceptions.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/UncategorizedSQLException.html

ArgumentPreparedStatementSetter	A										<section class="prog__container">Simple adapter for PreparedStatementSetter that applies a given array of arguments.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/core/ArgumentPreparedStatementSetter.html
ArgumentTypePreparedStatementSetter	A										<section class="prog__container">Simple adapter for PreparedStatementSetter that applies given arrays of arguments and JDBC argument types.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/core/ArgumentTypePreparedStatementSetter.html
BatchPreparedStatementSetter	A										<section class="prog__container">Batch update callback interface used by the JdbcTemplate class. This interface sets values on a PreparedStatement provided by the JdbcTemplate class, for each of a number of updates in a batch using the same SQL. Implementations are responsible for setting any necessary parameters. SQL with placeholders will already have been supplied. Implementations do not need to concern themselves with SQLExceptions that may be thrown from operations they attempt. The JdbcTemplate class will catch and handle SQLExceptions appropriately.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/core/BatchPreparedStatementSetter.html
BatchUpdateUtils	A										<section class="prog__container">Generic utility methods for working with JDBC batch statements. Mainly for internal use within the framework.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/core/BatchUpdateUtils.html
BeanPropertyRowMapper	A										<section class="prog__container">RowMapper implementation that converts a row into a new instance of the specified mapped target class. The mapped target class must be a top-level class and it must have a default or no-arg constructor. Column values are mapped based on matching the column name as obtained from result set metadata to public setters for the corresponding properties. The names are matched either directly or by transforming a name separating the parts with underscores to the same name using "camel" case. Mapping is provided for fields in the target class for many common types, e.g.: String, boolean, Boolean, byte, Byte, short, Short, int, Integer, long, Long, float, Float, double, Double, BigDecimal, java.util.Date, etc. To facilitate mapping between columns and fields that don't have matching names, try using column aliases in the SQL statement like "select fname as first_name from customer". For 'null' values read from the database, we will attempt to call the setter, but in the case of Java primitives, this causes a TypeMismatchException. This class can be configured (using the primitivesDefaultedForNullValue property) to trap this exception and use the primitives default value. Be aware that if you use the values from the generated bean to update the database the primitive value will have been set to the primitive's default value instead of null. Please note that this class is designed to provide convenience rather than high performance. For best performance, consider using a custom RowMapper implementation.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/core/BeanPropertyRowMapper.html
CallableStatementCallback	A										<section class="prog__container">Generic callback interface for code that operates on a CallableStatement. Allows to execute any number of operations on a single CallableStatement, for example a single execute call or repeated execute calls with varying parameters. Used internally by JdbcTemplate, but also useful for application code. Note that the passed-in CallableStatement can have been created by the framework or by a custom CallableStatementCreator. However, the latter is hardly ever necessary, as most custom callback actions will perform updates in which case a standard CallableStatement is fine. Custom actions will always set parameter values themselves, so that CallableStatementCreator capability is not needed either.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/core/CallableStatementCallback.html
CallableStatementCreator	A										<section class="prog__container">One of the three central callback interfaces used by the JdbcTemplate class. This interface creates a CallableStatement given a connection, provided by the JdbcTemplate class. Implementations are responsible for providing SQL and any necessary parameters. Implementations do not need to concern themselves with SQLExceptions that may be thrown from operations they attempt. The JdbcTemplate class will catch and handle SQLExceptions appropriately. A PreparedStatementCreator should also implement the SqlProvider interface if it is able to provide the SQL it uses for PreparedStatement creation. This allows for better contextual information in case of exceptions.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/core/CallableStatementCreator.html
CallableStatementCreatorFactory	A										<section class="prog__container">Helper class that efficiently creates multiple CallableStatementCreator objects with different parameters based on a SQL statement and a single set of parameter declarations.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/core/CallableStatementCreatorFactory.html
ColumnMapRowMapper	A										<section class="prog__container">RowMapper implementation that creates a java.util.Map for each row, representing all columns as key-value pairs: one entry for each column, with the column name as key. The Map implementation to use and the key to use for each column in the column Map can be customized through overriding createColumnMap(int) and getColumnKey(java.lang.String), respectively. Note: By default, ColumnMapRowMapper will try to build a linked Map with case-insensitive keys, to preserve column order as well as allow any casing to be used for column names. This requires Commons Collections on the classpath (which will be autodetected). Else, the fallback is a standard linked HashMap, which will still preserve column order but requires the application to specify the column names in the same casing as exposed by the driver.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/core/ColumnMapRowMapper.html
ConnectionCallback	A										<section class="prog__container">Generic callback interface for code that operates on a JDBC Connection. Allows to execute any number of operations on a single Connection, using any type and number of Statements. This is particularly useful for delegating to existing data access code that expects a Connection to work on and throws SQLException. For newly written code, it is strongly recommended to use JdbcTemplate's more specific operations, for example a query or update variant.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/core/ConnectionCallback.html
DisposableSqlTypeValue	A										<section class="prog__container">Subinterface of SqlTypeValue that adds a cleanup callback, to be invoked after the value has been set and the corresponding statement has been executed.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/core/DisposableSqlTypeValue.html
InterruptibleBatchPreparedStatementSetter	A										<section class="prog__container">Extension of the BatchPreparedStatementSetter interface, adding a batch exhaustion check. This interface allows you to signal the end of a batch rather than having to determine the exact batch size upfront. Batch size is still being honored but it is now the maximum size of the batch. The isBatchExhausted(int) method is called after each call to BatchPreparedStatementSetter.setValues(java.sql.PreparedStatement, int) to determine whether there were some values added, or if the batch was determined to be complete and no additional values were provided during the last call to setValues. Consider extending the AbstractInterruptibleBatchPreparedStatementSetter base class instead of implementing this interface directly, using a single setValuesIfAvailable callback method that checks for available values and sets them, returning whether values have actually been provided.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/core/InterruptibleBatchPreparedStatementSetter.html
JdbcOperations	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface specifying a basic set of JDBC operations. Implemented by JdbcTemplate. Not often used directly, but a useful option to enhance testability, as it can easily be mocked or stubbed. Alternatively, the standard JDBC infrastructure can be mocked. However, mocking this interface constitutes significantly less work. As an alternative to a mock objects approach to testing data access code, consider the powerful integration testing support provided in the org.springframework.test package, shipped in spring-test.jar.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/core/JdbcOperations.html
JdbcTemplate	A										<section class="prog__container">This is the central class in the JDBC core package. It simplifies the use of JDBC and helps to avoid common errors. It executes core JDBC workflow, leaving application code to provide SQL and extract results. This class executes SQL queries or updates, initiating iteration over ResultSets and catching JDBC exceptions and translating them to the generic, more informative exception hierarchy defined in the org.springframework.dao package. Code using this class need only implement callback interfaces, giving them a clearly defined contract. The PreparedStatementCreator callback interface creates a prepared statement given a Connection, providing SQL and any necessary parameters. The ResultSetExtractor interface extracts values from a ResultSet. See also PreparedStatementSetter and RowMapper for two popular alternative callback interfaces. Can be used within a service implementation via direct instantiation with a DataSource reference, or get prepared in an application context and given to services as bean reference. Note: The DataSource should always be configured as a bean in the application context, in the first case given to the service directly, in the second case to the prepared template. Because this class is parameterizable by the callback interfaces and the SQLExceptionTranslator interface, there should be no need to subclass it. All SQL operations performed by this class are logged at debug level, using "org.springframework.jdbc.core.JdbcTemplate" as log category. NOTE: An instance of this class is thread-safe once configured.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/core/JdbcTemplate.html
ParameterDisposer	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface to be implemented by objects that can close resources allocated by parameters like SqlLobValues. Typically implemented by PreparedStatementCreators and PreparedStatementSetters that support DisposableSqlTypeValue objects (e.g. SqlLobValue) as parameters.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/core/ParameterDisposer.html
ParameterizedPreparedStatementSetter	A										<section class="prog__container">Parameterized callback interface used by the JdbcTemplate class for batch updates. This interface sets values on a PreparedStatement provided by the JdbcTemplate class, for each of a number of updates in a batch using the same SQL. Implementations are responsible for setting any necessary parameters. SQL with placeholders will already have been supplied. Implementations do not need to concern themselves with SQLExceptions that may be thrown from operations they attempt. The JdbcTemplate class will catch and handle SQLExceptions appropriately.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/core/ParameterizedPreparedStatementSetter.html
ParameterMapper	A										<section class="prog__container">Implement this interface when parameters need to be customized based on the connection. We might need to do this to make use of proprietary features, available only with a specific Connection type.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/core/ParameterMapper.html
PreparedStatementCallback	A										<section class="prog__container">Generic callback interface for code that operates on a PreparedStatement. Allows to execute any number of operations on a single PreparedStatement, for example a single executeUpdate call or repeated executeUpdate calls with varying parameters. Used internally by JdbcTemplate, but also useful for application code. Note that the passed-in PreparedStatement can have been created by the framework or by a custom PreparedStatementCreator. However, the latter is hardly ever necessary, as most custom callback actions will perform updates in which case a standard PreparedStatement is fine. Custom actions will always set parameter values themselves, so that PreparedStatementCreator capability is not needed either.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/core/PreparedStatementCallback.html
PreparedStatementCreator	A										<section class="prog__container">One of the two central callback interfaces used by the JdbcTemplate class. This interface creates a PreparedStatement given a connection, provided by the JdbcTemplate class. Implementations are responsible for providing SQL and any necessary parameters. Implementations do not need to concern themselves with SQLExceptions that may be thrown from operations they attempt. The JdbcTemplate class will catch and handle SQLExceptions appropriately. A PreparedStatementCreator should also implement the SqlProvider interface if it is able to provide the SQL it uses for PreparedStatement creation. This allows for better contextual information in case of exceptions.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/core/PreparedStatementCreator.html
PreparedStatementCreatorFactory	A										<section class="prog__container">Helper class that efficiently creates multiple PreparedStatementCreator objects with different parameters based on a SQL statement and a single set of parameter declarations.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/core/PreparedStatementCreatorFactory.html
PreparedStatementSetter	A										<section class="prog__container">General callback interface used by the JdbcTemplate class. This interface sets values on a PreparedStatement provided by the JdbcTemplate class, for each of a number of updates in a batch using the same SQL. Implementations are responsible for setting any necessary parameters. SQL with placeholders will already have been supplied. It's easier to use this interface than PreparedStatementCreator: The JdbcTemplate will create the PreparedStatement, with the callback only being responsible for setting parameter values. Implementations do not need to concern themselves with SQLExceptions that may be thrown from operations they attempt. The JdbcTemplate class will catch and handle SQLExceptions appropriately.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/core/PreparedStatementSetter.html
ResultSetExtractor	A										<section class="prog__container">Callback interface used by JdbcTemplate's query methods. Implementations of this interface perform the actual work of extracting results from a ResultSet, but don't need to worry about exception handling. SQLExceptions will be caught and handled by the calling JdbcTemplate. This interface is mainly used within the JDBC framework itself. A RowMapper is usually a simpler choice for ResultSet processing, mapping one result object per row instead of one result object for the entire ResultSet. Note: In contrast to a RowCallbackHandler, a ResultSetExtractor object is typically stateless and thus reusable, as long as it doesn't access stateful resources (such as output streams when streaming LOB contents) or keep result state within the object.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/core/ResultSetExtractor.html
ResultSetSupportingSqlParameter	A										<section class="prog__container">Common base class for ResultSet-supporting SqlParameters like SqlOutParameter and SqlReturnResultSet.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/core/ResultSetSupportingSqlParameter.html
RowCallbackHandler	A										<section class="prog__container">An interface used by JdbcTemplate for processing rows of a ResultSet on a per-row basis. Implementations of this interface perform the actual work of processing each row but don't need to worry about exception handling. SQLExceptions will be caught and handled by the calling JdbcTemplate. In contrast to a ResultSetExtractor, a RowCallbackHandler object is typically stateful: It keeps the result state within the object, to be available for later inspection. See RowCountCallbackHandler for a usage example. Consider using a RowMapper instead if you need to map exactly one result object per row, assembling them into a List.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/core/RowCallbackHandler.html
RowCountCallbackHandler	A										<section class="prog__container">Implementation of RowCallbackHandler. Convenient superclass for callback handlers. An instance can only be used once. We can either use this on its own (for example, in a test case, to ensure that our result sets have valid dimensions), or use it as a superclass for callback handlers that actually do something, and will benefit from the dimension information it provides. A usage example with JdbcTemplate: JdbcTemplate jdbcTemplate = new JdbcTemplate(dataSource);  // reusable object RowCountCallbackHandler countCallback = new RowCountCallbackHandler();  // not reusable jdbcTemplate.query("select * from user", countCallback); int rowCount = countCallback.getRowCount();</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/core/RowCountCallbackHandler.html
RowMapper	A										<section class="prog__container">An interface used by JdbcTemplate for mapping rows of a ResultSet on a per-row basis. Implementations of this interface perform the actual work of mapping each row to a result object, but don't need to worry about exception handling. SQLExceptions will be caught and handled by the calling JdbcTemplate. Typically used either for JdbcTemplate's query methods or for out parameters of stored procedures. RowMapper objects are typically stateless and thus reusable; they are an ideal choice for implementing row-mapping logic in a single place. Alternatively, consider subclassing MappingSqlQuery from the jdbc.object package: Instead of working with separate JdbcTemplate and RowMapper objects, you can build executable query objects (containing row-mapping logic) in that style.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/core/RowMapper.html
RowMapperResultSetExtractor	A										<section class="prog__container">Adapter implementation of the ResultSetExtractor interface that delegates to a RowMapper which is supposed to create an object for each row. Each object is added to the results List of this ResultSetExtractor. Useful for the typical case of one object per row in the database table. The number of entries in the results list will match the number of rows. Note that a RowMapper object is typically stateless and thus reusable; just the RowMapperResultSetExtractor adapter is stateful. A usage example with JdbcTemplate: JdbcTemplate jdbcTemplate = new JdbcTemplate(dataSource);  // reusable object RowMapper rowMapper = new UserRowMapper();  // reusable object List allUsers = (List) jdbcTemplate.query(     "select * from user",     new RowMapperResultSetExtractor(rowMapper, 10)); User user = (User) jdbcTemplate.queryForObject(     "select * from user where id=?", new Object[] {id},     new RowMapperResultSetExtractor(rowMapper, 1));Alternatively, consider subclassing MappingSqlQuery from the jdbc.object package: Instead of working with separate JdbcTemplate and RowMapper objects, you can have executable query objects (containing row-mapping logic) there.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/core/RowMapperResultSetExtractor.html
SingleColumnRowMapper	A										<section class="prog__container">RowMapper implementation that converts a single column into a single result value per row. Expects to operate on a java.sql.ResultSet that just contains a single column. The type of the result value for each row can be specified. The value for the single column will be extracted from the ResultSet and converted into the specified target type.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/core/SingleColumnRowMapper.html
SqlInOutParameter	A										<section class="prog__container">Subclass of SqlOutParameter to represent an INOUT parameter. Will return true for SqlParameter's isInputValueProvided() test, in contrast to a standard SqlOutParameter. Output parameters - like all stored procedure parameters - must have names.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/core/SqlInOutParameter.html
SqlOutParameter	A										<section class="prog__container">Subclass of SqlParameter to represent an output parameter. No additional properties: instanceof will be used to check for such types. Output parameters - like all stored procedure parameters - must have names.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/core/SqlOutParameter.html
SqlParameter	A										<section class="prog__container">Object to represent a SQL parameter definition. Parameters may be anonymous, in which case "name" is null. However, all parameters must define a SQL type according to Types.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/core/SqlParameter.html
SqlParameterValue	A										<section class="prog__container">Object to represent a SQL parameter value, including parameter metadata such as the SQL type and the scale for numeric values. Designed for use with JdbcTemplate's operations that take an array of argument values: Each such argument value may be a SqlParameterValue, indicating the SQL type (and optionally the scale) instead of letting the template guess a default type. Note that this only applies to the operations with a 'plain' argument array, not to the overloaded variants with an explicit type array.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/core/SqlParameterValue.html
SqlProvider	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface to be implemented by objects that can provide SQL strings. Typically implemented by PreparedStatementCreators, CallableStatementCreators and StatementCallbacks that want to expose the SQL they use to create their statements, to allow for better contextual information in case of exceptions.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/core/SqlProvider.html
SqlReturnResultSet	A										<section class="prog__container">Represents a returned ResultSet from a stored procedure call. A ResultSetExtractor, RowCallbackHandler or RowMapper must be provided to handle any returned rows. Returned ResultSets - like all stored procedure parameters - must have names.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/core/SqlReturnResultSet.html
SqlReturnType	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface to be implemented for retrieving values for more complex database-specific types not supported by the standard CallableStatement.getObject method. Implementations perform the actual work of getting the actual values. They must implement the callback method getTypeValue which can throw SQLExceptions that will be caught and translated by the calling code. This callback method has access to the underlying Connection via the given CallableStatement object, if that should be needed to create any database-specific objects.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/core/SqlReturnType.html
SqlReturnUpdateCount	A										<section class="prog__container">Represents a returned update count from a stored procedure call. Returned update counts - like all stored procedure parameters - must have names.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/core/SqlReturnUpdateCount.html
SqlRowSetResultSetExtractor	A										<section class="prog__container">ResultSetExtractor implementation that returns a Spring SqlRowSet representation for each given ResultSet. The default implementation uses a standard JDBC CachedRowSet underneath. This means that JDBC RowSet support needs to be available at runtime: by default, Sun's com.sun.rowset.CachedRowSetImpl class on Java 6, or the javax.sql.rowset.RowSetProvider mechanism on Java 7+ / JDBC 4.1+.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/core/SqlRowSetResultSetExtractor.html
SqlTypeValue	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface to be implemented for setting values for more complex database-specific types not supported by the standard setObject method. This is effectively an extended variant of SqlValue. Implementations perform the actual work of setting the actual values. They must implement the callback method setTypeValue which can throw SQLExceptions that will be caught and translated by the calling code. This callback method has access to the underlying Connection via the given PreparedStatement object, if that should be needed to create any database-specific objects.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/core/SqlTypeValue.html
StatementCallback	A										<section class="prog__container">Generic callback interface for code that operates on a JDBC Statement. Allows to execute any number of operations on a single Statement, for example a single executeUpdate call or repeated executeUpdate calls with varying SQL. Used internally by JdbcTemplate, but also useful for application code.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/core/StatementCallback.html
StatementCreatorUtils	A										<section class="prog__container">Utility methods for PreparedStatementSetter/Creator and CallableStatementCreator implementations, providing sophisticated parameter management (including support for LOB values).

SimpleJdbcCall	A										<section class="prog__container">A SimpleJdbcCall is a multi-threaded, reusable object representing a call to a stored procedure or a stored function. It provides meta data processing to simplify the code needed to access basic stored procedures/functions. All you need to provide is the name of the procedure/function and a Map containing the parameters when you execute the call. The names of the supplied parameters will be matched up with in and out parameters declared when the stored procedure was created. The meta data processing is based on the DatabaseMetaData provided by the JDBC driver. Since we rely on the JDBC driver, this "auto-detection" can only be used for databases that are known to provide accurate meta data. These currently include Derby, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, DB2, Sybase and PostgreSQL. For any other databases you are required to declare all parameters explicitly. You can of course declare all parameters explicitly even if the database provides the necessary meta data. In that case your declared parameters will take precedence. You can also turn off any metadata processing if you want to use parameter names that do not match what is declared during the stored procedure compilation. The actual insert is being handled using Spring's JdbcTemplate. Many of the configuration methods return the current instance of the SimpleJdbcCall in order to provide the ability to chain multiple ones together in a "fluent" interface style.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/core/simple/SimpleJdbcCall.html

SimpleJdbcInsert	A										<section class="prog__container">A SimpleJdbcInsert is a multi-threaded, reusable object providing easy insert capabilities for a table. It provides meta data processing to simplify the code needed to construct a basic insert statement. All you need to provide is the name of the table and a Map containing the column names and the column values. The meta data processing is based on the DatabaseMetaData provided by the JDBC driver. As long as the JDBC driver can provide the names of the columns for a specified table than we can rely on this auto-detection feature. If that is not the case, then the column names must be specified explicitly. The actual insert is being handled using Spring's JdbcTemplate. Many of the configuration methods return the current instance of the SimpleJdbcInsert to provide the ability to chain multiple ones together in a "fluent" interface style.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/core/simple/SimpleJdbcInsert.html

A usage example with JdbcTemplate: JdbcTemplate jdbcTemplate = new JdbcTemplate(dataSource);  // reusable object LobHandler lobHandler = new DefaultLobHandler();  // reusable object jdbcTemplate.execute(     "INSERT INTO imagedb (image_name, content, description) VALUES (?, ?, ?)",     new AbstractLobCreatingPreparedStatementCallback(lobHandler) {       protected void setValues(PreparedStatement ps, LobCreator lobCreator) throws SQLException {         ps.setString(1, name);         lobCreator.setBlobAsBinaryStream(ps, 2, contentStream, contentLength);         lobCreator.setClobAsString(ps, 3, description);       }     } );</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/core/support/AbstractLobCreatingPreparedStatementCallback.html
AbstractLobStreamingResultSetExtractor	A										<section class="prog__container">Abstract ResultSetExtractor implementation that assumes streaming of LOB data. Typically used as inner class, with access to surrounding method arguments. Delegates to the streamData template method for streaming LOB content to some OutputStream, typically using a LobHandler. Converts an IOException thrown during streaming to a LobRetrievalFailureException. A usage example with JdbcTemplate: JdbcTemplate jdbcTemplate = new JdbcTemplate(dataSource);  // reusable object final LobHandler lobHandler = new DefaultLobHandler();  // reusable object jdbcTemplate.query(                 "SELECT content FROM imagedb WHERE image_name=?", new Object[] {name},                 new AbstractLobStreamingResultSetExtractor() {                         public void streamData(ResultSet rs) throws SQLException, IOException {                                 FileCopyUtils.copy(lobHandler.getBlobAsBinaryStream(rs, 1), contentStream);             }         } );</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/core/support/AbstractLobStreamingResultSetExtractor.html
AbstractSqlTypeValue	A										<section class="prog__container">Abstract implementation of the SqlTypeValue interface, for convenient creation of type values that are supposed to be passed into the PreparedStatement.setObject method. The createTypeValue callback method has access to the underlying Connection, if that should be needed to create any database-specific objects. A usage example from a StoredProcedure (compare this to the plain SqlTypeValue version in the superclass javadoc): proc.declareParameter(new SqlParameter("myarray", Types.ARRAY, "NUMBERS")); ... Map<String, Object> in = new HashMap<String, Object>(); in.put("myarray", new AbstractSqlTypeValue() {   public Object createTypeValue(Connection con, int sqlType, String typeName) throws SQLException {           oracle.sql.ArrayDescriptor desc = new oracle.sql.ArrayDescriptor(typeName, con);           return new oracle.sql.ARRAY(desc, con, seats);   } }); Map out = execute(in); </section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/core/support/AbstractSqlTypeValue.html
JdbcBeanDefinitionReader	A										<section class="prog__container">Bean definition reader that reads values from a database table, based on a given SQL statement. Expects columns for bean name, property name and value as String. Formats for each are identical to the properties format recognized by PropertiesBeanDefinitionReader. NOTE: This is mainly intended as an example for a custom JDBC-based bean definition reader. It does not aim to offer comprehensive functionality.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/core/support/JdbcBeanDefinitionReader.html
JdbcDaoSupport	A										<section class="prog__container">Convenient super class for JDBC-based data access objects. Requires a DataSource to be set, providing a JdbcTemplate based on it to subclasses through the getJdbcTemplate() method. This base class is mainly intended for JdbcTemplate usage but can also be used when working with a Connection directly or when using org.springframework.jdbc.object operation objects.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/core/support/JdbcDaoSupport.html
SqlLobValue	A										<section class="prog__container">Object to represent an SQL BLOB/CLOB value parameter. BLOBs can either be an InputStream or a byte array. CLOBs can be in the form of a Reader, InputStream or String. Each CLOB/BLOB value will be stored together with its length. The type is based on which constructor is used. Objects of this class are immutable except for the LobCreator reference. Use them and discard them. This class holds a reference to a LocCreator that must be closed after the update has completed. This is done via a call to the closeLobCreator method. All handling of the LobCreator is done by the framework classes that use it - no need to set or close the LobCreator for end users of this class. A usage example: JdbcTemplate jdbcTemplate = new JdbcTemplate(dataSource);  // reusable object LobHandler lobHandler = new DefaultLobHandler();  // reusable object jdbcTemplate.update(     "INSERT INTO imagedb (image_name, content, description) VALUES (?, ?, ?)",     new Object[] {       name,       new SqlLobValue(contentStream, contentLength, lobHandler),       new SqlLobValue(description, lobHandler)     },     new int[] {Types.VARCHAR, Types.BLOB, Types.CLOB}); </section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/core/support/SqlLobValue.html
AbstractDataSource	A										<section class="prog__container">Abstract base class for Spring's DataSource implementations, taking care of the padding.

ConnectionHolder	A										<section class="prog__container">Connection holder, wrapping a JDBC Connection. DataSourceTransactionManager binds instances of this class to the thread, for a specific DataSource. Inherits rollback-only support for nested JDBC transactions and reference count functionality from the base class. Note: This is an SPI class, not intended to be used by applications.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/datasource/ConnectionHolder.html
ConnectionProxy	A										<section class="prog__container">Subinterface of Connection to be implemented by Connection proxies. Allows access to the underlying target Connection. This interface can be checked when there is a need to cast to a native JDBC Connection such as Oracle's OracleConnection. Spring's NativeJdbcExtractorAdapter automatically detects such proxies before delegating to the actual unwrapping for a specific connection pool.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/datasource/ConnectionProxy.html
DataSourceTransactionManager	A										<section class="prog__container">PlatformTransactionManager implementation for a single JDBC DataSource. This class is capable of working in any environment with any JDBC driver, as long as the setup uses a javax.sql.DataSource as its Connection factory mechanism. Binds a JDBC Connection from the specified DataSource to the current thread, potentially allowing for one thread-bound Connection per DataSource. Note: The DataSource that this transaction manager operates on needs to return independent Connections. The Connections may come from a pool (the typical case), but the DataSource must not return thread-scoped / request-scoped Connections or the like. This transaction manager will associate Connections with thread-bound transactions itself, according to the specified propagation behavior. It assumes that a separate, independent Connection can be obtained even during an ongoing transaction. Application code is required to retrieve the JDBC Connection via DataSourceUtils.getConnection(DataSource) instead of a standard Java EE-style DataSource.getConnection() call. Spring classes such as JdbcTemplate use this strategy implicitly. If not used in combination with this transaction manager, the DataSourceUtils lookup strategy behaves exactly like the native DataSource lookup; it can thus be used in a portable fashion. Alternatively, you can allow application code to work with the standard Java EE-style lookup pattern DataSource.getConnection(), for example for legacy code that is not aware of Spring at all. In that case, define a TransactionAwareDataSourceProxy for your target DataSource, and pass that proxy DataSource to your DAOs, which will automatically participate in Spring-managed transactions when accessing it. Supports custom isolation levels, and timeouts which get applied as appropriate JDBC statement timeouts. To support the latter, application code must either use JdbcTemplate, call DataSourceUtils.applyTransactionTimeout(java.sql.Statement, javax.sql.DataSource) for each created JDBC Statement, or go through a TransactionAwareDataSourceProxy which will create timeout-aware JDBC Connections and Statements automatically. Consider defining a LazyConnectionDataSourceProxy for your target DataSource, pointing both this transaction manager and your DAOs to it. This will lead to optimized handling of "empty" transactions, i.e. of transactions without any JDBC statements executed. A LazyConnectionDataSourceProxy will not fetch an actual JDBC Connection from the target DataSource until a Statement gets executed, lazily applying the specified transaction settings to the target Connection. This transaction manager supports nested transactions via the JDBC 3.0 Savepoint mechanism. The "nestedTransactionAllowed" flag defaults to "true", since nested transactions will work without restrictions on JDBC drivers that support savepoints (such as the Oracle JDBC driver). This transaction manager can be used as a replacement for the JtaTransactionManager in the single resource case, as it does not require a container that supports JTA, typically in combination with a locally defined JDBC DataSource (e.g. an Apache Commons DBCP connection pool). Switching between this local strategy and a JTA environment is just a matter of configuration! As of 4.3.4, this transaction manager triggers flush callbacks on registered transaction synchronizations (if synchronization is generally active), assuming resources operating on the underlying JDBC Connection. This allows for setup analogous to JtaTransactionManager, in particular with respect to lazily registered ORM resources (e.g. a Hibernate Session).</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/datasource/DataSourceTransactionManager.html
DataSourceUtils	A										<section class="prog__container">Helper class that provides static methods for obtaining JDBC Connections from a DataSource. Includes special support for Spring-managed transactional Connections, e.g. managed by DataSourceTransactionManager or JtaTransactionManager. Used internally by Spring's JdbcTemplate, Spring's JDBC operation objects and the JDBC DataSourceTransactionManager. Can also be used directly in application code.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/datasource/DataSourceUtils.html
DelegatingDataSource	A										<section class="prog__container">JDBC DataSource implementation that delegates all calls to a given target DataSource. This class is meant to be subclassed, with subclasses overriding only those methods (such as getConnection()) that should not simply delegate to the target DataSource.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/datasource/DelegatingDataSource.html
DriverManagerDataSource	A										<section class="prog__container">Simple implementation of the standard JDBC DataSource interface, configuring the plain old JDBC DriverManager via bean properties, and returning a new Connection from every getConnection call. NOTE: This class is not an actual connection pool; it does not actually pool Connections. It just serves as simple replacement for a full-blown connection pool, implementing the same standard interface, but creating new Connections on every call. Useful for test or standalone environments outside of a J2EE container, either as a DataSource bean in a corresponding ApplicationContext or in conjunction with a simple JNDI environment. Pool-assuming Connection.close() calls will simply close the Connection, so any DataSource-aware persistence code should work. NOTE: Within special class loading environments such as OSGi, this class is effectively superseded by SimpleDriverDataSource due to general class loading issues with the JDBC DriverManager that be resolved through direct Driver usage (which is exactly what SimpleDriverDataSource does).In a J2EE container, it is recommended to use a JNDI DataSource provided by the container. Such a DataSource can be exposed as a DataSource bean in a Spring ApplicationContext via JndiObjectFactoryBean, for seamless switching to and from a local DataSource bean like this class. For tests, you can then either set up a mock JNDI environment through Spring's SimpleNamingContextBuilder, or switch the bean definition to a local DataSource (which is simpler and thus recommended). If you need a "real" connection pool outside of a J2EE container, consider Apache Commons DBCP or C3P0. Commons DBCP's BasicDataSource and C3P0's ComboPooledDataSource are full connection pool beans, supporting the same basic properties as this class plus specific settings (such as minimal/maximal pool size etc).</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/datasource/DriverManagerDataSource.html
IsolationLevelDataSourceAdapter	A										<section class="prog__container">An adapter for a target DataSource, applying the current Spring transaction's isolation level (and potentially specified user credentials) to every getConnection call. Also applies the read-only flag, if specified. Can be used to proxy a target JNDI DataSource that does not have the desired isolation level (and user credentials) configured. Client code can work with this DataSource as usual, not worrying about such settings. Inherits the capability to apply specific user credentials from its superclass UserCredentialsDataSourceAdapter; see the latter's javadoc for details on that functionality (e.g. UserCredentialsDataSourceAdapter.setCredentialsForCurrentThread(java.lang.String, java.lang.String)). WARNING: This adapter simply calls Connection.setTransactionIsolation(int) and/or Connection.setReadOnly(boolean) for every Connection obtained from it. It does, however, not reset those settings; it rather expects the target DataSource to perform such resetting as part of its connection pool handling. Make sure that the target DataSource properly cleans up such transaction state.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/datasource/IsolationLevelDataSourceAdapter.html
JdbcTransactionObjectSupport	A										<section class="prog__container">Convenient base class for JDBC-aware transaction objects. Can contain a ConnectionHolder, and implements the SavepointManager interface based on that ConnectionHolder. Allows for programmatic management of JDBC 3.0 Savepoints. Spring's DefaultTransactionStatus will automatically delegate to this, as it autodetects transaction objects that implement the SavepointManager interface.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/datasource/JdbcTransactionObjectSupport.html
LazyConnectionDataSourceProxy	A										<section class="prog__container">Proxy for a target DataSource, fetching actual JDBC Connections lazily, i.e. not until first creation of a Statement. Connection initialization properties like auto-commit mode, transaction isolation and read-only mode will be kept and applied to the actual JDBC Connection as soon as an actual Connection is fetched (if ever). Consequently, commit and rollback calls will be ignored if no Statements have been created. This DataSource proxy allows to avoid fetching JDBC Connections from a pool unless actually necessary. JDBC transaction control can happen without fetching a Connection from the pool or communicating with the database; this will be done lazily on first creation of a JDBC Statement. If you configure both a LazyConnectionDataSourceProxy and a TransactionAwareDataSourceProxy, make sure that the latter is the outermost DataSource. In such a scenario, data access code will talk to the transaction-aware DataSource, which will in turn work with the LazyConnectionDataSourceProxy. Lazy fetching of physical JDBC Connections is particularly beneficial in a generic transaction demarcation environment. It allows you to demarcate transactions on all methods that could potentially perform data access, without paying a performance penalty if no actual data access happens. This DataSource proxy gives you behavior analogous to JTA and a transactional JNDI DataSource (as provided by the J2EE server), even with a local transaction strategy like DataSourceTransactionManager or HibernateTransactionManager. It does not add value with Spring's JtaTransactionManager as transaction strategy. Lazy fetching of JDBC Connections is also recommended for read-only operations with Hibernate, in particular if the chances of resolving the result in the second-level cache are high. This avoids the need to communicate with the database at all for such read-only operations. You will get the same effect with non-transactional reads, but lazy fetching of JDBC Connections allows you to still perform reads in transactions. NOTE: This DataSource proxy needs to return wrapped Connections (which implement the ConnectionProxy interface) in order to handle lazy fetching of an actual JDBC Connection. Therefore, the returned Connections cannot be cast to a native JDBC Connection type such as OracleConnection or to a connection pool implementation type. Use a corresponding NativeJdbcExtractor or JDBC 4's Wrapper.unwrap(java.lang.Class<T>) to retrieve the native JDBC Connection.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/datasource/LazyConnectionDataSourceProxy.html
SimpleConnectionHandle	A										<section class="prog__container">Simple implementation of the ConnectionHandle interface, containing a given JDBC Connection.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/datasource/SimpleConnectionHandle.html
SimpleDriverDataSource	A										<section class="prog__container">Simple implementation of the standard JDBC DataSource interface, configuring a plain old JDBC Driver via bean properties, and returning a new Connection from every getConnection call. NOTE: This class is not an actual connection pool; it does not actually pool Connections. It just serves as simple replacement for a full-blown connection pool, implementing the same standard interface, but creating new Connections on every call. In a J2EE container, it is recommended to use a JNDI DataSource provided by the container. Such a DataSource can be exposed as a DataSource bean in a Spring ApplicationContext via JndiObjectFactoryBean, for seamless switching to and from a local DataSource bean like this class.

SingleConnectionDataSource	A										<section class="prog__container">Implementation of SmartDataSource that wraps a single JDBC Connection which is not closed after use. Obviously, this is not multi-threading capable. Note that at shutdown, someone should close the underlying Connection via the close() method. Client code will never call close on the Connection handle if it is SmartDataSource-aware (e.g. uses DataSourceUtils.releaseConnection). If client code will call close() in the assumption of a pooled Connection, like when using persistence tools, set "suppressClose" to "true". This will return a close-suppressing proxy instead of the physical Connection. Be aware that you will not be able to cast this to a native OracleConnection or the like anymore; you need to use a NativeJdbcExtractor then. This is primarily intended for testing. For example, it enables easy testing outside an application server, for code that expects to work on a DataSource. In contrast to DriverManagerDataSource, it reuses the same Connection all the time, avoiding excessive creation of physical Connections.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/datasource/SingleConnectionDataSource.html
SmartDataSource	A										<section class="prog__container">Extension of the javax.sql.DataSource interface, to be implemented by special DataSources that return JDBC Connections in an unwrapped fashion. Classes using this interface can query whether or not the Connection should be closed after an operation. Spring's DataSourceUtils and JdbcTemplate classes automatically perform such a check.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/datasource/SmartDataSource.html
TransactionAwareDataSourceProxy	A										<section class="prog__container">Proxy for a target JDBC DataSource, adding awareness of Spring-managed transactions. Similar to a transactional JNDI DataSource as provided by a J2EE server. Data access code that should remain unaware of Spring's data access support can work with this proxy to seamlessly participate in Spring-managed transactions. Note that the transaction manager, for example DataSourceTransactionManager, still needs to work with the underlying DataSource, not with this proxy. Make sure that TransactionAwareDataSourceProxy is the outermost DataSource of a chain of DataSource proxies/adapters. TransactionAwareDataSourceProxy can delegate either directly to the target connection pool or to some intermediary proxy/adapter like LazyConnectionDataSourceProxy or UserCredentialsDataSourceAdapter. Delegates to DataSourceUtils for automatically participating in thread-bound transactions, for example managed by DataSourceTransactionManager. getConnection calls and close calls on returned Connections will behave properly within a transaction, i.e. always operate on the transactional Connection. If not within a transaction, normal DataSource behavior applies. This proxy allows data access code to work with the plain JDBC API and still participate in Spring-managed transactions, similar to JDBC code in a J2EE/JTA environment. However, if possible, use Spring's DataSourceUtils, JdbcTemplate or JDBC operation objects to get transaction participation even without a proxy for the target DataSource, avoiding the need to define such a proxy in the first place. As a further effect, using a transaction-aware DataSource will apply remaining transaction timeouts to all created JDBC (Prepared/Callable)Statement. This means that all operations performed through standard JDBC will automatically participate in Spring-managed transaction timeouts. NOTE: This DataSource proxy needs to return wrapped Connections (which implement the ConnectionProxy interface) in order to handle close calls properly. Therefore, the returned Connections cannot be cast to a native JDBC Connection type such as OracleConnection or to a connection pool implementation type. Use a corresponding NativeJdbcExtractor or JDBC 4's Wrapper.unwrap(java.lang.Class<T>) to retrieve the native JDBC Connection.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/datasource/TransactionAwareDataSourceProxy.html
UserCredentialsDataSourceAdapter	A										<section class="prog__container">An adapter for a target JDBC DataSource, applying the specified user credentials to every standard getConnection() call, implicitly invoking getConnection(username, password) on the target. All other methods simply delegate to the corresponding methods of the target DataSource. Can be used to proxy a target JNDI DataSource that does not have user credentials configured. Client code can work with this DataSource as usual, using the standard getConnection() call. In the following example, client code can simply transparently work with the preconfigured "myDataSource", implicitly accessing "myTargetDataSource" with the specified user credentials.  <bean id="myTargetDataSource" class="org.springframework.jndi.JndiObjectFactoryBean">   <property name="jndiName" value="java:comp/env/jdbc/myds"/> </bean> <bean id="myDataSource" class="org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.UserCredentialsDataSourceAdapter">   <property name="targetDataSource" ref="myTargetDataSource"/>   <property name="username" value="myusername"/>   <property name="password" value="mypassword"/> </bean>If the "username" is empty, this proxy will simply delegate to the standard getConnection() method of the target DataSource. This can be used to keep a UserCredentialsDataSourceAdapter bean definition just for the option of implicitly passing in user credentials if the particular target DataSource requires it.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/datasource/UserCredentialsDataSourceAdapter.html
WebSphereDataSourceAdapter	A										<section class="prog__container">DataSource implementation that delegates all calls to a WebSphere target DataSource, typically obtained from JNDI, applying a current isolation level and/or current user credentials to every Connection obtained from it. Uses IBM-specific API to get a JDBC Connection with a specific isolation level (and read-only flag) from a WebSphere DataSource (IBM code example). Supports the transaction-specific isolation level exposed by TransactionSynchronizationManager.getCurrentTransactionIsolationLevel(). It's also possible to specify a default isolation level, to be applied when the current Spring-managed transaction does not define a specific isolation level. Usage example, defining the target DataSource as an inner-bean JNDI lookup (of course, you can link to any WebSphere DataSource through a bean reference):  <bean id="myDataSource" class="org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.WebSphereDataSourceAdapter">   <property name="targetDataSource">     <bean class="org.springframework.jndi.JndiObjectFactoryBean">       <property name="jndiName" value="jdbc/myds"/>     </bean>   </property> </bean> Thanks to Ricardo Olivieri for submitting the original implementation of this approach!</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/datasource/WebSphereDataSourceAdapter.html

IsolationLevelDataSourceRouter	A										<section class="prog__container">DataSource that routes to one of various target DataSources based on the current transaction isolation level. The target DataSources need to be configured with the isolation level name as key, as defined on the TransactionDefinition interface. This is particularly useful in combination with JTA transaction management (typically through Spring's JtaTransactionManager). Standard JTA does not support transaction-specific isolation levels. Some JTA providers support isolation levels as a vendor-specific extension (e.g. WebLogic), which is the preferred way of addressing this. As alternative (e.g. on WebSphere), the target database can be represented through multiple JNDI DataSources, each configured with a different isolation level (for the entire DataSource). The present DataSource router allows to transparently switch to the appropriate DataSource based on the current transaction's isolation level. The configuration can for example look like this, assuming that the target DataSources are defined as individual Spring beans with names "myRepeatableReadDataSource", "mySerializableDataSource" and "myDefaultDataSource":  <bean id="dataSourceRouter" class="org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.lookup.IsolationLevelDataSourceRouter">   <property name="targetDataSources">     <map>       <entry key="ISOLATION_REPEATABLE_READ" value-ref="myRepeatableReadDataSource"/>       <entry key="ISOLATION_SERIALIZABLE" value-ref="mySerializableDataSource"/>     </map>   </property>   <property name="defaultTargetDataSource" ref="myDefaultDataSource"/> </bean> Alternatively, the keyed values can also be data source names, to be resolved through a DataSourceLookup: by default, JNDI names for a standard JNDI lookup. This allows for a single concise definition without the need for separate DataSource bean definitions.  <bean id="dataSourceRouter" class="org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.lookup.IsolationLevelDataSourceRouter">   <property name="targetDataSources">     <map>       <entry key="ISOLATION_REPEATABLE_READ" value="java:comp/env/jdbc/myrrds"/>       <entry key="ISOLATION_SERIALIZABLE" value="java:comp/env/jdbc/myserds"/>     </map>   </property>   <property name="defaultTargetDataSource" value="java:comp/env/jdbc/mydefds"/> </bean> Note: If you are using this router in combination with Spring's JtaTransactionManager, don't forget to switch the "allowCustomIsolationLevels" flag to "true". (By default, JtaTransactionManager will only accept a default isolation level because of the lack of isolation level support in standard JTA itself.)  <bean id="transactionManager" class="org.springframework.transaction.jta.JtaTransactionManager">   <property name="allowCustomIsolationLevels" value="true"/> </bean></section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/datasource/lookup/IsolationLevelDataSourceRouter.html

BatchSqlUpdate	A										<section class="prog__container">SqlUpdate subclass that performs batch update operations. Encapsulates queuing up records to be updated, and adds them as a single batch once flush is called or the given batch size has been met. Note that this class is a non-thread-safe object, in contrast to all other JDBC operations objects in this package. You need to create a new instance of it for each use, or call reset before reuse within the same thread.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/object/BatchSqlUpdate.html

GenericStoredProcedure	A										<section class="prog__container">Concrete implementation making it possible to define the RDBMS stored procedures in an application context without writing a custom Java implementation class.  This implementation does not provide a typed method for invocation so executions must use one of the generic StoredProcedure.execute(java.util.Map) or StoredProcedure.execute(org.springframework.jdbc.core.ParameterMapper) methods.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/object/GenericStoredProcedure.html
MappingSqlQuery	A										<section class="prog__container">Reusable query in which concrete subclasses must implement the abstract mapRow(ResultSet, int) method to convert each row of the JDBC ResultSet into an object. Simplifies MappingSqlQueryWithParameters API by dropping parameters and context. Most subclasses won't care about parameters. If you don't use contextual information, subclass this instead of MappingSqlQueryWithParameters.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/object/MappingSqlQuery.html
MappingSqlQueryWithParameters	A										<section class="prog__container">Reusable RDBMS query in which concrete subclasses must implement the abstract mapRow(ResultSet, int) method to map each row of the JDBC ResultSet into an object. Such manual mapping is usually preferable to "automatic" mapping using reflection, which can become complex in non-trivial cases. For example, the present class allows different objects to be used for different rows (for example, if a subclass is indicated). It allows computed fields to be set. And there's no need for ResultSet columns to have the same names as bean properties. The Pareto Principle in action: going the extra mile to automate the extraction process makes the framework much more complex and delivers little real benefit. Subclasses can be constructed providing SQL, parameter types and a DataSource. SQL will often vary between subclasses.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/object/MappingSqlQueryWithParameters.html

RdbmsOperation	A										<section class="prog__container">An "RDBMS operation" is a multi-threaded, reusable object representing a query, update, or stored procedure call. An RDBMS operation is not a command, as a command is not reusable. However, execute methods may take commands as arguments. Subclasses should be JavaBeans, allowing easy configuration. This class and subclasses throw runtime exceptions, defined in the  (and as thrown by the org.springframework.jdbc.core package, which the classes in this package use under the hood to perform raw JDBC operations). Subclasses should set SQL and add parameters before invoking the compile() method. The order in which parameters are added is significant. The appropriate execute or update method can then be invoked.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/object/RdbmsOperation.html
SqlCall	A										<section class="prog__container">RdbmsOperation using a JdbcTemplate and representing a SQL-based call such as a stored procedure or a stored function. Configures a CallableStatementCreatorFactory based on the declared parameters.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/object/SqlCall.html
SqlFunction	A										<section class="prog__container">SQL "function" wrapper for a query that returns a single row of results. The default behavior is to return an int, but that can be overridden by using the constructor with an extra return type parameter. Intended to use to call SQL functions that return a single result using a query like "select user()" or "select sysdate from dual". It is not intended for calling more complex stored functions or for using a CallableStatement to invoke a stored procedure or stored function. Use StoredProcedure or SqlCall for this type of processing. This is a concrete class, which there is often no need to subclass. Code using this package can create an object of this type, declaring SQL and parameters, and then invoke the appropriate run method repeatedly to execute the function. Subclasses are only supposed to add specialized run methods for specific parameter and return types. Like all RdbmsOperation objects, SqlFunction objects are thread-safe.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/object/SqlFunction.html
SqlOperation	A										<section class="prog__container">Operation object representing a SQL-based operation such as a query or update, as opposed to a stored procedure.

SqlQuery	A										<section class="prog__container">Reusable operation object representing a SQL query. Subclasses must implement the newRowMapper(java.lang.Object[], java.util.Map<?, ?>) method to provide an object that can extract the results of iterating over the ResultSet created during the execution of the query. This class provides a number of public execute methods that are analogous to the different convenient JDO query execute methods. Subclasses can either rely on one of these inherited methods, or can add their own custom execution methods, with meaningful names and typed parameters (definitely a best practice). Each custom query method will invoke one of this class's untyped query methods. Like all RdbmsOperation classes that ship with the Spring Framework, SqlQuery instances are thread-safe after their initialization is complete. That is, after they are constructed and configured via their setter methods, they can be used safely from multiple threads.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/object/SqlQuery.html
SqlUpdate	A										<section class="prog__container">Reusable operation object representing a SQL update. This class provides a number of update methods, analogous to the execute methods of query objects. This class is concrete. Although it can be subclassed (for example to add a custom update method) it can easily be parameterized by setting SQL and declaring parameters. Like all RdbmsOperation classes that ship with the Spring Framework, SqlQuery instances are thread-safe after their initialization is complete. That is, after they are constructed and configured via their setter methods, they can be used safely from multiple threads.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/object/SqlUpdate.html
StoredProcedure	A										<section class="prog__container">Superclass for object abstractions of RDBMS stored procedures. This class is abstract and it is intended that subclasses will provide a typed method for invocation that delegates to the supplied execute(java.lang.Object...) method.

SQLExceptions will be caught and handled correctly by the JdbcUtils class.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/support/DatabaseMetaDataCallback.html
DatabaseStartupValidator	A										<section class="prog__container">Bean that checks if a database has already started up. To be referenced via "depends-on" from beans that depend on database startup, like a Hibernate SessionFactory or custom data access objects that access a DataSource directly. Useful to defer application initialization until a database has started up. Particularly appropriate for waiting on a slowly starting Oracle database.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/support/DatabaseStartupValidator.html
GeneratedKeyHolder	A										<section class="prog__container">Default implementation of the KeyHolder interface, to be used for holding auto-generated keys (as potentially returned by JDBC insert statements).

KeyHolder	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface for retrieving keys, typically used for auto-generated keys as potentially returned by JDBC insert statements. Implementations of this interface can hold any number of keys. In the general case, the keys are returned as a List containing one Map for each row of keys. Most applications only use on key per row and process only one row at a time in an insert statement. In these cases, just call getKey to retrieve the key. The returned value is a Number here, which is the usual type for auto-generated keys.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/support/KeyHolder.html
MetaDataAccessException	A										<section class="prog__container">Exception indicating that something went wrong during JDBC metadata lookup. This is a checked exception since we want it to be caught, logged and handled rather than cause the application to fail. Failure to read JDBC metadata is usually not a fatal problem.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/support/MetaDataAccessException.html
SQLErrorCodes	A										<section class="prog__container">JavaBean for holding JDBC error codes for a particular database. Instances of this class are normally loaded through a bean factory. Used by Spring's SQLErrorCodeSQLExceptionTranslator. The file "sql-error-codes.xml" in this package contains default SQLErrorCodes instances for various databases.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/support/SQLErrorCodes.html
SQLErrorCodesFactory	A										<section class="prog__container">Factory for creating SQLErrorCodes based on the "databaseProductName" taken from the DatabaseMetaData.

SQLErrorCodeSQLExceptionTranslator	A										<section class="prog__container">Implementation of SQLExceptionTranslator that analyzes vendor-specific error codes. More precise than an implementation based on SQL state, but heavily vendor-specific. This class applies the following matching rules: Try custom translation implemented by any subclass. Note that this class is concrete and is typically used itself, in which case this rule doesn't apply. Apply error code matching. Error codes are obtained from the SQLErrorCodesFactory by default. This factory loads a "sql-error-codes.xml" file from the class path, defining error code mappings for database names from database metadata. Fallback to a fallback translator. SQLStateSQLExceptionTranslator is the default fallback translator, analyzing the exception's SQL state only. On Java 6 which introduces its own SQLException subclass hierarchy, we will use SQLExceptionSubclassTranslator by default, which in turns falls back to Spring's own SQL state translation when not encountering specific subclasses. The configuration file named "sql-error-codes.xml" is by default read from this package. It can be overridden through a file of the same name in the root of the class path (e.g. in the "/WEB-INF/classes" directory), as long as the Spring JDBC package is loaded from the same ClassLoader.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/support/SQLErrorCodeSQLExceptionTranslator.html

SQLExceptionTranslator	A										<section class="prog__container">Strategy interface for translating between SQLExceptions and Spring's data access strategy-agnostic DataAccessException hierarchy. Implementations can be generic (for example, using SQLState codes for JDBC) or wholly proprietary (for example, using Oracle error codes) for greater precision.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/support/SQLExceptionTranslator.html
SQLStateSQLExceptionTranslator	A										<section class="prog__container">SQLExceptionTranslator implementation that analyzes the SQL state in the SQLException based on the first two digits (the SQL state "class"). Detects standard SQL state values and well-known vendor-specific SQL states. Not able to diagnose all problems, but is portable between databases and does not require special initialization (no database vendor detection, etc.). For more precise translation, consider SQLErrorCodeSQLExceptionTranslator.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/support/SQLStateSQLExceptionTranslator.html
SqlValue	A										<section class="prog__container">Simple interface for complex types to be set as statement parameters. Implementations perform the actual work of setting the actual values.

DerbyMaxValueIncrementer	A										<section class="prog__container">DataFieldMaxValueIncrementer that increments the maximum value of a given Derby table with the equivalent of an auto-increment column. Note: If you use this class, your Derby key column should NOT be defined as an IDENTITY column, as the sequence table does the job. The sequence is kept in a table. There should be one sequence table per table that needs an auto-generated key. Derby requires an additional column to be used for the insert since it is impossible to insert a null into the identity column and have the value generated.  This is solved by providing the name of a dummy column that also must be created in the sequence table. Example: create table tab (id int not null primary key, text varchar(100)); create table tab_sequence (value int generated always as identity, dummy char(1)); insert into tab_sequence (dummy) values(null); If "cacheSize" is set, the intermediate values are served without querying the database. If the server or your application is stopped or crashes or a transaction is rolled back, the unused values will never be served. The maximum hole size in numbering is consequently the value of cacheSize. HINT: Since Derby supports the JDBC 3.0 getGeneratedKeys method, it is recommended to use IDENTITY columns directly in the tables and then utilizing a KeyHolder when calling the with the update(PreparedStatementCreator psc, KeyHolder generatedKeyHolder) method of the JdbcTemplate.

Note: If you use this class, your MySQL key column should NOT be auto-increment, as the sequence table does the job. The sequence is kept in a table; there should be one sequence table per table that needs an auto-generated key. The table type of the sequence table should be MyISAM so the sequences are allocated without regard to any transactions that might be in progress. Example: create table tab (id int unsigned not null primary key, text varchar(100)); create table tab_sequence (value int not null) type=MYISAM; insert into tab_sequence values(0); If "cacheSize" is set, the intermediate values are served without querying the database.

DefaultLobHandler	A										<section class="prog__container">Default implementation of the LobHandler interface. Invokes the direct accessor methods that java.sql.ResultSet and java.sql.PreparedStatement offer. By default, incoming streams are going to be passed to the appropriate setBinary/Ascii/CharacterStream method on the JDBC driver's PreparedStatement. If the specified content length is negative, this handler will use the JDBC 4.0 variants of the set-stream methods without a length parameter; otherwise, it will pass the specified length on to the driver. This LobHandler should work for any JDBC driver that is JDBC compliant in terms of the spec's suggestions regarding simple BLOB and CLOB handling. This does not apply to Oracle 9i's drivers at all; as of Oracle 10g, it does work but may still come with LOB size limitations. Consider using recent Oracle drivers even when working against an older database server. See the LobHandler javadoc for the full set of recommendations. Some JDBC drivers require values with a BLOB/CLOB target column to be explicitly set through the JDBC setBlob / setClob API: for example, PostgreSQL's driver. Switch the "wrapAsLob" property to "true" when operating against such a driver. On JDBC 4.0, this LobHandler also supports streaming the BLOB/CLOB content via the setBlob / setClob variants that take a stream argument directly. Consider switching the "streamAsLob" property to "true" when operating against a fully compliant JDBC 4.0 driver. Finally, primarily as a direct equivalent to OracleLobHandler, this LobHandler also supports the creation of temporary BLOB/CLOB objects. Consider switching the "createTemporaryLob" property to "true" when "streamAsLob" happens to run into LOB size limitations. See the LobHandler interface javadoc for a summary of recommendations.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/support/lob/DefaultLobHandler.html

LobCreator	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface that abstracts potentially database-specific creation of large binary fields and large text fields. Does not work with java.sql.Blob and java.sql.Clob instances in the API, as some JDBC drivers do not support these types as such. The LOB creation part is where LobHandler implementations usually differ. Possible strategies include usage of PreparedStatement.setBinaryStream/setCharacterStream but also PreparedStatement.setBlob/setClob with either a stream argument (requires JDBC 4.0) or java.sql.Blob/Clob wrapper objects. A LobCreator represents a session for creating BLOBs: It is not thread-safe and needs to be instantiated for each statement execution or for each transaction. Each LobCreator needs to be closed after completion. For convenient working with a PreparedStatement and a LobCreator, consider using JdbcTemplate with anAbstractLobCreatingPreparedStatementCallback implementation. See the latter's javadoc for details.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/support/lob/LobCreator.html

LobHandler	A										<section class="prog__container">Abstraction for handling large binary fields and large text fields in specific databases, no matter if represented as simple types or Large OBjects. Its main purpose is to isolate Oracle 9i's peculiar handling of LOBs in OracleLobHandler; most other databases should be able to work with the provided DefaultLobHandler. Provides accessor methods for BLOBs and CLOBs, and acts as factory for LobCreator instances, to be used as sessions for creating BLOBs or CLOBs. LobCreators are typically instantiated for each statement execution or for each transaction; they are not thread-safe because they might track allocated database resources in order to free them after execution. Most databases/drivers should be able to work with DefaultLobHandler, which by default delegates to JDBC's direct accessor methods, avoiding the java.sql.Blob and java.sql.Clob API completely. DefaultLobHandler can also be configured to access LOBs using PreparedStatement.setBlob/setClob (e.g. for PostgreSQL), through setting the "wrapAsLob" property. Unfortunately, Oracle 9i just accepts Blob/Clob instances created via its own proprietary BLOB/CLOB API, and additionally doesn't accept large streams for PreparedStatement's corresponding setter methods. Therefore, you need to use OracleLobHandler there, which uses Oracle's BLOB/CLOB API for both types of access. The Oracle 10g+ JDBC driver will work with DefaultLobHandler as well, with some limitations in terms of LOB sizes depending on DBMS setup; as of Oracle 11g (or actually, using the 11g driver even against older databases), there should be no need to use OracleLobHandler at all anymore. Of course, you need to declare different field types for each database. In Oracle, any binary content needs to go into a BLOB, and all character content beyond 4000 bytes needs to go into a CLOB. In MySQL, there is no notion of a CLOB type but rather a LONGTEXT type that behaves like a VARCHAR. For complete portability, use a LobHandler for fields that might typically require LOBs on some database because of the field size (take Oracle's numbers as a guideline). Summarizing the recommended options (for actual LOB fields):JDBC 4.0 driver (including Oracle 11g driver): Use DefaultLobHandler, potentially with streamAsLob=true if your database driver requires that hint when populating a LOB field. Fall back to createTemporaryLob=true if you happen to run into LOB size limitations with your (Oracle) database setup. Oracle 10g driver: Use DefaultLobHandler with standard setup. On Oracle 10.1, set the "SetBigStringTryClob" connection property; as of Oracle 10.2, DefaultLobHandler should work with standard setup out of the box. Alternatively, consider using the proprietary OracleLobHandler (see below). Oracle 9i driver: Use OracleLobHandler with a connection-pool-specific NativeJdbcExtractor. PostgreSQL: Configure DefaultLobHandler with wrapAsLob=true, and use that LobHandler to access OID columns (but not BYTEA) in your database tables. For all other database drivers (and for non-LOB fields that might potentially turn into LOBs on some databases): Simply use a plain DefaultLobHandler. </section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/support/lob/LobHandler.html

Jdbc4NativeJdbcExtractor	A										<section class="prog__container">NativeJdbcExtractor implementation that delegates to JDBC 4.0's unwrap method, as defined by Wrapper. You will typically need to specify a vendor Connection type / Statement type / ResultSet type to extract, since JDBC 4.0 only actually unwraps to a given target type. Note: Only use this when actually running against a JDBC 4.0 driver, with a connection pool that supports the JDBC 4.0 API (i.e. at least accepts JDBC 4.0 API calls and passes them through to the underlying driver)! Other than that, there is no need for connection pool specific setup. As of JDBC 4.0, NativeJdbcExtractors will typically be implemented for specific drivers instead of for specific pools (e.g. OracleJdbc4NativeJdbcExtractor).</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/support/nativejdbc/Jdbc4NativeJdbcExtractor.html
NativeJdbcExtractor	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface for extracting native JDBC objects from wrapped objects coming from connection pools. This is necessary to allow for casting to native implementations like OracleConnection or OracleResultSet in application code, for example to create Blobs or to access vendor-specific features. Note: Setting a custom NativeJdbcExtractor is just necessary if you intend to cast to database-specific implementations like OracleConnection or OracleResultSet. Otherwise, any wrapped JDBC object will be fine, with no need for unwrapping. Note: To be able to support any pool's strategy of native ResultSet wrapping, it is advisable to get both the native Statement and the native ResultSet via this extractor. Some pools just allow to unwrap the Statement, some just to unwrap the ResultSet - the above strategy will cover both. It is typically not necessary to unwrap the Connection to retrieve a native ResultSet. When working with a simple connection pool that wraps Connections but not Statements, a SimpleNativeJdbcExtractor is often sufficient. However, some pools (like Apache's Commons DBCP) wrap all JDBC objects that they return: Therefore, you need to use a specific NativeJdbcExtractor (like CommonsDbcpNativeJdbcExtractor) with them. JdbcTemplate can properly apply a NativeJdbcExtractor if specified, unwrapping all JDBC objects that it creates. Note that this is just necessary if you intend to cast to native implementations in your data access code. OracleLobHandler, the Oracle-specific implementation of Spring's LobHandler interface, requires a NativeJdbcExtractor for obtaining the native OracleConnection. This is also necessary for other Oracle-specific features that you may want to leverage in your applications, such as Oracle InterMedia.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/support/nativejdbc/NativeJdbcExtractor.html
NativeJdbcExtractorAdapter	A										<section class="prog__container">Abstract adapter class for the NativeJdbcExtractor interface, for simplified implementation of basic extractors. Basically returns the passed-in JDBC objects on all methods. getNativeConnection checks for a ConnectionProxy chain, for example from a TransactionAwareDataSourceProxy, before delegating to doGetNativeConnection for actual unwrapping. You can override either of the two for a specific connection pool, but the latter is recommended to participate in ConnectionProxy unwrapping. getNativeConnection also applies a fallback if the first native extraction process failed, that is, returned the same Connection as passed in. It assumes that some additional proxying is going in this case: Hence, it retrieves the underlying native Connection from the DatabaseMetaData via conHandle.getMetaData().getConnection() and retries the native extraction process based on that Connection handle. This works, for example, for the Connection proxies exposed by Hibernate 3.1's Session.connection(). The getNativeConnectionFromStatement method is implemented to simply delegate to getNativeConnection with the Statement's Connection. This is what most extractor implementations will stick to, unless there's a more efficient version for a specific pool.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/support/nativejdbc/NativeJdbcExtractorAdapter.html

In other words, as of JDBC 4.0, NativeJdbcExtractors will typically be implemented for specific drivers instead of for specific pools.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/support/nativejdbc/OracleJdbc4NativeJdbcExtractor.html
SimpleNativeJdbcExtractor	A										<section class="prog__container">A simple implementation of the NativeJdbcExtractor interface. Assumes a pool that wraps Connection handles but not DatabaseMetaData: In this case, the underlying native Connection can be retrieved by simply calling conHandle.getMetaData().getConnection(). All other JDBC objects will be returned as passed in. This extractor should work with any pool that does not wrap DatabaseMetaData, and will also work with any plain JDBC driver. Note that a pool can still wrap Statements, PreparedStatements, etc: The only requirement of this extractor is that java.sql.DatabaseMetaData does not get wrapped, returning the native Connection of the JDBC driver on metaData.getConnection(). Customize this extractor by setting the "nativeConnectionNecessaryForXxx" flags accordingly: If Statements, PreparedStatements, and/or CallableStatements are wrapped by your pool, set the corresponding "nativeConnectionNecessaryForXxx" flags to "true". If none of the statement types is wrapped - or you solely need Connection unwrapping in the first place -, the defaults are fine. SimpleNativeJdbcExtractor is a common choice for use with OracleLobHandler, which just needs Connection unwrapping via the NativeJdbcExtractorAdapter.getNativeConnectionFromStatement(java.sql.Statement) method. This usage will work with almost any connection pool. For full usage with JdbcTemplate, i.e. to also provide Statement unwrapping: Use a default SimpleNativeJdbcExtractor for Resin and SJSAS (no JDBC Statement objects are wrapped, therefore no special unwrapping is necessary). Use a SimpleNativeJdbcExtractor with all "nativeConnectionNecessaryForXxx" flags set to "true" for C3P0 (all JDBC Statement objects are wrapped, but none of the wrappers allow for unwrapping). Use a CommonsDbcpNativeJdbcExtractor for Apache Commons DBCP or a JBossNativeJdbcExtractor for JBoss (all JDBC Statement objects are wrapped, but all of them can be extracted by casting to implementation classes). </section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/support/nativejdbc/SimpleNativeJdbcExtractor.html
WebLogicNativeJdbcExtractor	A										<section class="prog__container">Implementation of the NativeJdbcExtractor interface for WebLogic, supporting WebLogic Server 9.0 and higher.

ResultSetWrappingSqlRowSet	A										<section class="prog__container">The default implementation of Spring's SqlRowSet interface, wrapping a ResultSet, catching any SQLExceptions and translating them to a corresponding Spring InvalidResultSetAccessException. The passed-in ResultSet should already be disconnected if the SqlRowSet is supposed to be usable in a disconnected fashion. This means that you will usually pass in a javax.sql.rowset.CachedRowSet, which implements the ResultSet interface. Note: Since JDBC 4.0, it has been clarified that any methods using a String to identify the column should be using the column label. The column label is assigned using the ALIAS keyword in the SQL query string. When the query doesn't use an ALIAS, the default label is the column name. Most JDBC ResultSet implementations follow this new pattern but there are exceptions such as the com.sun.rowset.CachedRowSetImpl class which only uses the column name, ignoring any column labels. As of Spring 3.0.5, ResultSetWrappingSqlRowSet will translate column labels to the correct column index to provide better support for the com.sun.rowset.CachedRowSetImpl which is the default implementation used by JdbcTemplate when working with RowSets. Note: This class implements the java.io.Serializable marker interface through the SqlRowSet interface, but is only actually serializable if the disconnected ResultSet/RowSet contained in it is serializable. Most CachedRowSet implementations are actually serializable, so this should usually work out.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/support/rowset/ResultSetWrappingSqlRowSet.html

EnableJms	A										<section class="prog__container">Enable JMS listener annotated endpoints that are created under the cover by a JmsListenerContainerFactory. To be used on Configuration classes as follows:  @Configuration @EnableJms public class AppConfig {     @Bean     public DefaultJmsListenerContainerFactory myJmsListenerContainerFactory() {       DefaultJmsListenerContainerFactory factory = new DefaultJmsListenerContainerFactory();       factory.setConnectionFactory(connectionFactory());       factory.setDestinationResolver(destinationResolver());       factory.setConcurrency("5");       return factory;     }     // other @Bean definitions } The JmsListenerContainerFactory is responsible to create the listener container responsible for a particular endpoint. Typical implementations, as the DefaultJmsListenerContainerFactory used in the sample above, provides the necessary configuration options that are supported by the underlying MessageListenerContainer. @EnableJms enables detection of JmsListener annotations on any Spring-managed bean in the container. For example, given a class MyService:  package com.acme.foo; public class MyService {     @JmsListener(containerFactory = "myJmsListenerContainerFactory", destination="myQueue")     public void process(String msg) {         // process incoming message     } } The container factory to use is identified by the containerFactory attribute defining the name of the JmsListenerContainerFactory bean to use.  When none is set a JmsListenerContainerFactory bean with name jmsListenerContainerFactory is assumed to be present. the following configuration would ensure that every time a Message is received on the Destination named "myQueue", MyService.process() is called with the content of the message:  @Configuration @EnableJms public class AppConfig {     @Bean     public MyService myService() {         return new MyService();     }     // JMS infrastructure setup } Alternatively, if MyService were annotated with @Component, the following configuration would ensure that its @JmsListener annotated method is invoked with a matching incoming message:  @Configuration @EnableJms @ComponentScan(basePackages="com.acme.foo") public class AppConfig { } Note that the created containers are not registered against the application context but can be easily located for management purposes using the JmsListenerEndpointRegistry. Annotated methods can use flexible signature; in particular, it is possible to use the Message abstraction and related annotations, see JmsListener Javadoc for more details. For instance, the following would inject the content of the message and a custom "myCounter" JMS header:  @JmsListener(containerFactory = "myJmsListenerContainerFactory", destination="myQueue") public void process(String msg, @Header("myCounter") int counter) {     // process incoming message } These features are abstracted by the MessageHandlerMethodFactory that is responsible to build the necessary invoker to process the annotated method. By default, DefaultMessageHandlerMethodFactory is used. When more control is desired, a @Configuration class may implement JmsListenerConfigurer. This allows access to the underlying JmsListenerEndpointRegistrar instance. The following example demonstrates how to specify an explicit default JmsListenerContainerFactory @Configuration @EnableJms public class AppConfig implements JmsListenerConfigurer {     @Override     public void configureJmsListeners(JmsListenerEndpointRegistrar registrar) {         registrar.setContainerFactory(myJmsListenerContainerFactory());     }     @Bean     public JmsListenerContainerFactory myJmsListenerContainerFactory() {         // factory settings     }     @Bean     public MyService myService() {         return new MyService();     } } For reference, the example above can be compared to the following Spring XML configuration:  <beans>     <jms:annotation-driven container-factory="myJmsListenerContainerFactory"/>     <bean id="myJmsListenerContainerFactory" class="org.springframework.jms.config.DefaultJmsListenerContainerFactory">           // factory settings     </bean>     <bean id="myService" class="com.acme.foo.MyService"/> </beans>  It is also possible to specify a custom JmsListenerEndpointRegistry in case you need more control on the way the containers are created and managed. The example below also demonstrates how to customize the JmsHandlerMethodFactory to use with a custom Validator so that payloads annotated with Validated are first validated against a custom Validator.  @Configuration @EnableJms public class AppConfig implements JmsListenerConfigurer {     @Override     public void configureJmsListeners(JmsListenerEndpointRegistrar registrar) {         registrar.setEndpointRegistry(myJmsListenerEndpointRegistry());         registrar.setMessageHandlerMethodFactory(myJmsHandlerMethodFactory);     }     @Bean     public JmsListenerEndpointRegistry myJmsListenerEndpointRegistry() {         // registry configuration     }     @Bean     public JmsHandlerMethodFactory myJmsHandlerMethodFactory() {        DefaultJmsHandlerMethodFactory factory = new DefaultJmsHandlerMethodFactory();        factory.setValidator(new MyValidator());        return factory;     }     @Bean     public MyService myService() {         return new MyService();     } } For reference, the example above can be compared to the following Spring XML configuration:  <beans>     <jms:annotation-driven registry="myJmsListenerEndpointRegistry"         handler-method-factory="myJmsHandlerMethodFactory"/&gt;     <bean id="myJmsListenerEndpointRegistry"           class="org.springframework.jms.config.JmsListenerEndpointRegistry">           // registry configuration     </bean>     <bean id="myJmsHandlerMethodFactory"           class="org.springframework.messaging.handler.support.DefaultJmsHandlerMethodFactory">         <property name="validator" ref="myValidator"/>     </bean>     <bean id="myService" class="com.acme.foo.MyService"/> </beans>  Implementing JmsListenerConfigurer also allows for fine-grained control over endpoints registration via the JmsListenerEndpointRegistrar. For example, the following configures an extra endpoint:  @Configuration @EnableJms public class AppConfig implements JmsListenerConfigurer {     @Override     public void configureJmsListeners(JmsListenerEndpointRegistrar registrar) {         SimpleJmsListenerEndpoint myEndpoint = new SimpleJmsListenerEndpoint();         // ... configure the endpoint         registrar.registerEndpoint(endpoint, anotherJmsListenerContainerFactory());     }     @Bean     public MyService myService() {         return new MyService();     }     @Bean     public JmsListenerContainerFactory anotherJmsListenerContainerFactory() {         // ...     }     // JMS infrastructure setup } Note that all beans implementing JmsListenerConfigurer will be detected and invoked in a similar fashion. The example above can be translated in a regular bean definition registered in the context in case you use the XML configuration.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jms/annotation/EnableJms.html
JmsBootstrapConfiguration	A										<section class="prog__container">@Configuration class that registers a JmsListenerAnnotationBeanPostProcessor bean capable of processing Spring's @JmsListener annotation. Also register a default JmsListenerEndpointRegistry. This configuration class is automatically imported when using the @EnableJms annotation. See the EnableJms javadocs for complete usage details.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jms/annotation/JmsBootstrapConfiguration.html
JmsListener	A										<section class="prog__container">Annotation that marks a method to be the target of a JMS message listener on the specified destination(). The containerFactory() identifies the JmsListenerContainerFactory to use to build the JMS listener container. If not set, a default container factory is assumed to be available with a bean name of jmsListenerContainerFactory unless an explicit default has been provided through configuration. Processing of @JmsListener annotations is performed by registering a JmsListenerAnnotationBeanPostProcessor. This can be done manually or, more conveniently, through the <jms:annotation-driven/> element or @EnableJms annotation. Annotated JMS listener methods are allowed to have flexible signatures similar to what MessageMapping provides: Session to get access to the JMS sessionMessage or one of its subclasses to get access to the raw JMS messageMessage to use Spring's messaging abstraction counterpart@Payload-annotated method arguments, including support for validation@Header-annotated method arguments to extract specific header values, including standard JMS headers defined by JmsHeaders@Headers-annotated method argument that must also be assignable to Map for obtaining access to all headersMessageHeaders arguments for obtaining access to all headersMessageHeaderAccessor or JmsMessageHeaderAccessor for convenient access to all method argumentsAnnotated methods may have a non-void return type. When they do, the result of the method invocation is sent as a JMS reply to the destination defined by the JMSReplyTO header of the incoming message. If this header is not set, a default destination can be provided by adding @SendTo to the method declaration. This annotation may be used as a meta-annotation to create custom composed annotations with attribute overrides.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jms/annotation/JmsListener.html
JmsListenerAnnotationBeanPostProcessor	A										<section class="prog__container">Bean post-processor that registers methods annotated with JmsListener to be invoked by a JMS message listener container created under the cover by a JmsListenerContainerFactory according to the attributes of the annotation. Annotated methods can use flexible arguments as defined by JmsListener. This post-processor is automatically registered by Spring's <jms:annotation-driven> XML element, and also by the EnableJms annotation. Autodetects any JmsListenerConfigurer instances in the container, allowing for customization of the registry to be used, the default container factory or for fine-grained control over endpoints registration. See the EnableJms javadocs for complete usage details.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jms/annotation/JmsListenerAnnotationBeanPostProcessor.html
JmsListenerConfigurer	A										<section class="prog__container">Optional interface to be implemented by a Spring managed bean willing to customize how JMS listener endpoints are configured. Typically used to define the default JmsListenerContainerFactory to use or for registering JMS endpoints in a programmatic fashion as opposed to the declarative approach of using the @JmsListener annotation. See @EnableJms for detailed usage examples.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jms/annotation/JmsListenerConfigurer.html
JmsListeners	A										<section class="prog__container">Container annotation that aggregates several JmsListener annotations. Can be used natively, declaring several nested JmsListener annotations. Can also be used in conjunction with Java 8's support for repeatable annotations, where JmsListener can simply be declared several times on the same method, implicitly generating this container annotation. This annotation may be used as a meta-annotation to create custom composed annotations.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jms/annotation/JmsListeners.html

JmsListenerEndpointRegistry	A										<section class="prog__container">Creates the necessary MessageListenerContainer instances for the registered endpoints. Also manages the lifecycle of the listener containers, in particular within the lifecycle of the application context. Contrary to MessageListenerContainers created manually, listener containers managed by registry are not beans in the application context and are not candidates for autowiring. Use getListenerContainers() if you need to access this registry's listener containers for management purposes. If you need to access to a specific message listener container, use getListenerContainer(String) with the id of the endpoint.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jms/config/JmsListenerEndpointRegistry.html

CachingConnectionFactory	A										<section class="prog__container">SingleConnectionFactory subclass that adds Session caching as well MessageProducer caching. This ConnectionFactory also switches the "reconnectOnException" property to "true" by default, allowing for automatic recovery of the underlying Connection. By default, only one single Session will be cached, with further requested Sessions being created and disposed on demand. Consider raising the "sessionCacheSize" value in case of a high-concurrency environment. When using the JMS 1.0.2 API, this ConnectionFactory will switch into queue/topic mode according to the JMS API methods used at runtime: createQueueConnection and createTopicConnection will lead to queue/topic mode, respectively; generic createConnection calls will lead to a JMS 1.1 connection which is able to serve both modes. NOTE: This ConnectionFactory requires explicit closing of all Sessions obtained from its shared Connection. This is the usual recommendation for native JMS access code anyway. However, with this ConnectionFactory, its use is mandatory in order to actually allow for Session reuse. Note also that MessageConsumers obtained from a cached Session won't get closed until the Session will eventually be removed from the pool. This may lead to semantic side effects in some cases. For a durable subscriber, the logical Session.close() call will also close the subscription. Re-registering a durable consumer for the same subscription on the same Session handle is not supported; close and reobtain a cached Session first.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jms/connection/CachingConnectionFactory.html
ChainedExceptionListener	A										<section class="prog__container">Implementation of the JMS ExceptionListener interface that supports chaining, allowing the addition of multiple ExceptionListener instances in order.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jms/connection/ChainedExceptionListener.html
ConnectionFactoryUtils	A										<section class="prog__container">Helper class for managing a JMS ConnectionFactory, in particular for obtaining transactional JMS resources for a given ConnectionFactory.

Serving as argument for the doGetTransactionalSession method.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jms/connection/ConnectionFactoryUtils.ResourceFactory.html
DelegatingConnectionFactory	A										<section class="prog__container">ConnectionFactory implementation that delegates all calls to a given target ConnectionFactory, adapting specific create(Queue/Topic)Connection calls to the target ConnectionFactory if necessary (e.g. when running JMS 1.0.2 API based code against a generic JMS 1.1 ConnectionFactory, such as ActiveMQ's PooledConnectionFactory). This class allows for being subclassed, with subclasses overriding only those methods (such as createConnection()) that should not simply delegate to the target ConnectionFactory. Can also be defined as-is, wrapping a specific target ConnectionFactory, using the "shouldStopConnections" flag to indicate whether Connections obtained from the target factory are supposed to be stopped before closed. The latter may be necessary for some connection pools that simply return released connections to the pool, not stopping them while they sit in the pool.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jms/connection/DelegatingConnectionFactory.html
JmsResourceHolder	A										<section class="prog__container">JMS resource holder, wrapping a JMS Connection and a JMS Session. JmsTransactionManager binds instances of this class to the thread, for a given JMS ConnectionFactory. Note: This is an SPI class, not intended to be used by applications.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jms/connection/JmsResourceHolder.html
JmsTransactionManager	A										<section class="prog__container">PlatformTransactionManager implementation for a single JMS ConnectionFactory. Binds a JMS Connection/Session pair from the specified ConnectionFactory to the thread, potentially allowing for one thread-bound Session per ConnectionFactory. This local strategy is an alternative to executing JMS operations within JTA transactions. Its advantage is that it is able to work in any environment, for example a standalone application or a test suite, with any message broker as target. However, this strategy is not able to provide XA transactions, for example in order to share transactions between messaging and database access. A full JTA/XA setup is required for XA transactions, typically using Spring's JtaTransactionManager as strategy. Application code is required to retrieve the transactional JMS Session via ConnectionFactoryUtils.getTransactionalSession(javax.jms.ConnectionFactory, javax.jms.Connection, boolean) instead of a standard J2EE-style ConnectionFactory.createConnection() call with subsequent Session creation. Spring's JmsTemplate will autodetect a thread-bound Session and automatically participate in it. Alternatively, you can allow application code to work with the standard J2EE-style lookup pattern on a ConnectionFactory, for example for legacy code that is not aware of Spring at all. In that case, define a TransactionAwareConnectionFactoryProxy for your target ConnectionFactory, which will automatically participate in Spring-managed transactions. The use of CachingConnectionFactory as a target for this transaction manager is strongly recommended. CachingConnectionFactory uses a single JMS Connection for all JMS access in order to avoid the overhead of repeated Connection creation, as well as maintaining a cache of Sessions. Each transaction will then share the same JMS Connection, while still using its own individual JMS Session. The use of a raw target ConnectionFactory would not only be inefficient because of the lack of resource reuse. It might also lead to strange effects when your JMS driver doesn't accept MessageProducer.close() calls and/or MessageConsumer.close() calls before Session.commit(), with the latter supposed to commit all the messages that have been sent through the producer handle and received through the consumer handle. As a safe general solution, always pass in a CachingConnectionFactory into this transaction manager's "connectionFactory" property. Transaction synchronization is turned off by default, as this manager might be used alongside a datastore-based Spring transaction manager such as the JDBC DataSourceTransactionManager, which has stronger needs for synchronization.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jms/connection/JmsTransactionManager.html
SessionProxy	A										<section class="prog__container">Subinterface of Session to be implemented by Session proxies. Allows access to the underlying target Session.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jms/connection/SessionProxy.html
SingleConnectionFactory	A										<section class="prog__container">A JMS ConnectionFactory adapter that returns the same Connection from all createConnection() calls, and ignores calls to Connection.close(). According to the JMS Connection model, this is perfectly thread-safe (in contrast to e.g. JDBC). The shared Connection can be automatically recovered in case of an Exception. You can either pass in a specific JMS Connection directly or let this factory lazily create a Connection via a given target ConnectionFactory. This factory generally works with JMS 1.1 as well as the JMS 1.0.2 API. Note that when using the JMS 1.0.2 API, this ConnectionFactory will switch into queue/topic mode according to the JMS API methods used at runtime: createQueueConnection and createTopicConnection will lead to queue/topic mode, respectively; generic createConnection calls will lead to a JMS 1.1 connection which is able to serve both modes. Useful for testing and standalone environments in order to keep using the same Connection for multiple JmsTemplate calls, without having a pooling ConnectionFactory underneath. This may span any number of transactions, even concurrently executing transactions. Note that Spring's message listener containers support the use of a shared Connection within each listener container instance. Using SingleConnectionFactory in combination only really makes sense for sharing a single JMS Connection across multiple listener containers.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jms/connection/SingleConnectionFactory.html
SmartConnectionFactory	A										<section class="prog__container">Extension of the javax.jms.ConnectionFactory interface, indicating how to release Connections obtained from it.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jms/connection/SmartConnectionFactory.html
SynchedLocalTransactionFailedException	A										<section class="prog__container">Exception thrown when a synchronized local transaction failed to complete (after the main transaction has already completed).</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jms/connection/SynchedLocalTransactionFailedException.html
TransactionAwareConnectionFactoryProxy	A										<section class="prog__container">Proxy for a target JMS ConnectionFactory, adding awareness of Spring-managed transactions. Similar to a transactional JNDI ConnectionFactory as provided by a Java EE application server. Messaging code which should remain unaware of Spring's JMS support can work with this proxy to seamlessly participate in Spring-managed transactions. Note that the transaction manager, for example JmsTransactionManager, still needs to work with the underlying ConnectionFactory, not with this proxy. Make sure that TransactionAwareConnectionFactoryProxy is the outermost ConnectionFactory of a chain of ConnectionFactory proxies/adapters. TransactionAwareConnectionFactoryProxy can delegate either directly to the target factory or to some intermediary adapter like UserCredentialsConnectionFactoryAdapter. Delegates to ConnectionFactoryUtils for automatically participating in thread-bound transactions, for example managed by JmsTransactionManager. createSession calls and close calls on returned Sessions will behave properly within a transaction, that is, always work on the transactional Session. If not within a transaction, normal ConnectionFactory behavior applies. Note that transactional JMS Sessions will be registered on a per-Connection basis. To share the same JMS Session across a transaction, make sure that you operate on the same JMS Connection handle - either through reusing the handle or through configuring a SingleConnectionFactory underneath. Returned transactional Session proxies will implement the SessionProxy interface to allow for access to the underlying target Session. This is only intended for accessing vendor-specific Session API or for testing purposes (e.g. to perform manual transaction control). For typical application purposes, simply use the standard JMS Session interface.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jms/connection/TransactionAwareConnectionFactoryProxy.html
UserCredentialsConnectionFactoryAdapter	A										<section class="prog__container">An adapter for a target JMS ConnectionFactory, applying the given user credentials to every standard createConnection() call, that is, implicitly invoking createConnection(username, password) on the target. All other methods simply delegate to the corresponding methods of the target ConnectionFactory. Can be used to proxy a target JNDI ConnectionFactory that does not have user credentials configured. Client code can work with the ConnectionFactory without passing in username and password on every createConnection() call. In the following example, client code can simply transparently work with the preconfigured "myConnectionFactory", implicitly accessing "myTargetConnectionFactory" with the specified user credentials.  <bean id="myTargetConnectionFactory" class="org.springframework.jndi.JndiObjectFactoryBean">   <property name="jndiName" value="java:comp/env/jms/mycf"/> </bean> <bean id="myConnectionFactory" class="org.springframework.jms.connection.UserCredentialsConnectionFactoryAdapter">   <property name="targetConnectionFactory" ref="myTargetConnectionFactory"/>   <property name="username" value="myusername"/>   <property name="password" value="mypassword"/> </bean>If the "username" is empty, this proxy will simply delegate to the standard createConnection() method of the target ConnectionFactory. This can be used to keep a UserCredentialsConnectionFactoryAdapter bean definition just for the option of implicitly passing in user credentials if the particular target ConnectionFactory requires it.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jms/connection/UserCredentialsConnectionFactoryAdapter.html
BrowserCallback	A										<section class="prog__container">Callback for browsing the messages in a JMS queue. To be used with JmsTemplate's callback methods that take a BrowserCallback argument, often implemented as an anonymous inner class.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jms/core/BrowserCallback.html
JmsMessageOperations	A										<section class="prog__container">A specialization of MessageSendingOperations, MessageReceivingOperations and MessageRequestReplyOperations for JMS related operations that allow to specify a destination name rather than the actual Destination</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jms/core/JmsMessageOperations.html
JmsMessagingTemplate	A										<section class="prog__container">An implementation of JmsMessageOperations.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jms/core/JmsMessagingTemplate.html
JmsOperations	A										<section class="prog__container">Specifies a basic set of JMS operations. Implemented by JmsTemplate. Not often used but a useful option to enhance testability, as it can easily be mocked or stubbed. Provides JmsTemplate's send(..) and receive(..) methods that mirror various JMS API methods. See the JMS specification and javadocs for details on those methods. Provides also basic request reply operation using a temporary queue to collect the reply.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jms/core/JmsOperations.html
JmsTemplate	A										<section class="prog__container">Helper class that simplifies synchronous JMS access code. If you want to use dynamic destination creation, you must specify the type of JMS destination to create, using the "pubSubDomain" property. For other operations, this is not necessary. Point-to-Point (Queues) is the default domain. Default settings for JMS Sessions are "not transacted" and "auto-acknowledge". As defined by the Java EE specification, the transaction and acknowledgement parameters are ignored when a JMS Session is created inside an active transaction, no matter if a JTA transaction or a Spring-managed transaction. To configure them for native JMS usage, specify appropriate values for the "sessionTransacted" and "sessionAcknowledgeMode" bean properties. This template uses a DynamicDestinationResolver and a SimpleMessageConverter as default strategies for resolving a destination name or converting a message, respectively. These defaults can be overridden through the "destinationResolver" and "messageConverter" bean properties. NOTE: The ConnectionFactory used with this template should return pooled Connections (or a single shared Connection) as well as pooled Sessions and MessageProducers. Otherwise, performance of ad-hoc JMS operations is going to suffer. The simplest option is to use the Spring-provided SingleConnectionFactory as a decorator for your target ConnectionFactory, reusing a single JMS Connection in a thread-safe fashion; this is often good enough for the purpose of sending messages via this template. In a Java EE environment, make sure that the ConnectionFactory is obtained from the application's environment naming context via JNDI; application servers typically expose pooled, transaction-aware factories there.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jms/core/JmsTemplate.html
MessageCreator	A										<section class="prog__container">Creates a JMS message given a Session. The Session typically is provided by an instance of the JmsTemplate class. Implementations do not need to concern themselves with checked JMSExceptions (from the 'javax.jms' package) that may be thrown from operations they attempt. The JmsTemplate will catch and handle these JMSExceptions appropriately.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jms/core/MessageCreator.html
MessagePostProcessor	A										<section class="prog__container">To be used with JmsTemplate's send method that convert an object to a message.

ProducerCallback	A										<section class="prog__container">Callback for sending a message to a JMS destination. To be used with JmsTemplate's callback methods that take a ProducerCallback argument, often implemented as an anonymous inner class.

JmsGatewaySupport	A										<section class="prog__container">Convenient super class for application classes that need JMS access. Requires a ConnectionFactory or a JmsTemplate instance to be set. It will create its own JmsTemplate if a ConnectionFactory is passed in. A custom JmsTemplate instance can be created for a given ConnectionFactory through overriding the createJmsTemplate(javax.jms.ConnectionFactory) method.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jms/core/support/JmsGatewaySupport.html
AbstractJmsListeningContainer	A										<section class="prog__container">Common base class for all containers which need to implement listening based on a JMS Connection (either shared or freshly obtained for each attempt). Inherits basic Connection and Session configuration handling from the JmsAccessor base class. This class provides basic lifecycle management, in particular management of a shared JMS Connection. Subclasses are supposed to plug into this lifecycle, implementing the sharedConnectionEnabled() as well as the doInitialize() and doShutdown() template methods. This base class does not assume any specific listener programming model or listener invoker mechanism. It just provides the general runtime lifecycle management needed for any kind of JMS-based listening mechanism that operates on a JMS Connection/Session. For a concrete listener programming model, check out the AbstractMessageListenerContainer subclass. For a concrete listener invoker mechanism, check out the DefaultMessageListenerContainer class.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jms/listener/AbstractJmsListeningContainer.html
AbstractJmsListeningContainer.SharedConnectionNotInitializedException	A										<section class="prog__container">Exception that indicates that the initial setup of this container's shared JMS Connection failed. This is indicating to invokers that they need to establish the shared Connection themselves on first access.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jms/listener/AbstractJmsListeningContainer.SharedConnectionNotInitializedException.html
AbstractMessageListenerContainer	A										<section class="prog__container">Abstract base class for Spring message listener container implementations. Can either host a standard JMS MessageListener or Spring's SessionAwareMessageListener for actual message processing. Usually holds a single JMS Connection that all listeners are supposed to be registered on, which is the standard JMS way of managing listener sessions. Can alternatively also be used with a fresh Connection per listener, for Java EE style XA-aware JMS messaging. The actual registration process is up to concrete subclasses. NOTE: The default behavior of this message listener container is to never propagate an exception thrown by a message listener up to the JMS provider. Instead, it will log any such exception at the error level. This means that from the perspective of the attendant JMS provider no such listener will ever fail. However, if error handling is necessary, then any implementation of the ErrorHandler strategy may be provided to the setErrorHandler(ErrorHandler) method. Note that JMSExceptions will be passed to the ErrorHandler in addition to (but after) being passed to an ExceptionListener, if one has been provided. The listener container offers the following message acknowledgment options: "sessionAcknowledgeMode" set to "AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE" (default): This mode is container-dependent: For DefaultMessageListenerContainer, it means automatic message acknowledgment before listener execution, with no redelivery in case of an exception and no redelivery in case of other listener execution interruptions either. For SimpleMessageListenerContainer, it means automatic message acknowledgment after listener execution, with no redelivery in case of a user exception thrown but potential redelivery in case of the JVM dying during listener execution. In order to consistently arrange for redelivery with any container variant, consider "CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE" mode or - preferably - setting "sessionTransacted" to "true" instead. "sessionAcknowledgeMode" set to "DUPS_OK_ACKNOWLEDGE": Lazy message acknowledgment during (DefaultMessageListenerContainer) or shortly after (SimpleMessageListenerContainer) listener execution; no redelivery in case of a user exception thrown but potential redelivery in case of the JVM dying during listener execution. In order to consistently arrange for redelivery with any container variant, consider "CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE" mode or - preferably - setting "sessionTransacted" to "true" instead. "sessionAcknowledgeMode" set to "CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE": Automatic message acknowledgment after successful listener execution; best-effort redelivery in case of a user exception thrown as well as in case of other listener execution interruptions (such as the JVM dying). "sessionTransacted" set to "true": Transactional acknowledgment after successful listener execution; guaranteed redelivery in case of a user exception thrown as well as in case of other listener execution interruptions (such as the JVM dying). There are two solutions to the duplicate message processing problem: Either add duplicate message detection to your listener, in the form of a business entity existence check or a protocol table check. This usually just needs to be done in case of the JMSRedelivered flag being set on the incoming message (otherwise just process straightforwardly). Note that with "sessionTransacted" set to "true", duplicate messages will only appear in case of the JVM dying at the most unfortunate point possible (i.e. after your business logic executed but before the JMS part got committed), so duplicate message detection is just there to cover a corner case. Or wrap your entire processing with an XA transaction, covering the reception of the JMS message as well as the execution of the business logic in your message listener (including database operations etc). This is only supported by DefaultMessageListenerContainer, through specifying an external "transactionManager" (typically a JtaTransactionManager, with a corresponding XA-aware JMS ConnectionFactory passed in as "connectionFactory").  Note that XA transaction coordination adds significant runtime overhead, so it might be feasible to avoid it unless absolutely necessary. Recommendations:The general recommendation is to set "sessionTransacted" to "true", typically in combination with local database transactions triggered by the listener implementation, through Spring's standard transaction facilities. This will work nicely in Tomcat or in a standalone environment, often combined with custom duplicate message detection (if it is unacceptable to ever process the same message twice). Alternatively, specify a JtaTransactionManager as "transactionManager" for a fully XA-aware JMS provider - typically when running on a Java EE server, but also for other environments with a JTA transaction manager present. This will give full "exactly-once" guarantees without custom duplicate message checks, at the price of additional runtime processing overhead. Note that the "sessionTransacted" flag is strongly recommended over JmsTransactionManager, provided that transactions do not need to be managed externally. As a consequence, set the transaction manager only if you are using JTA or if you need to synchronize with custom external transaction arrangements.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jms/listener/AbstractMessageListenerContainer.html
AbstractPollingMessageListenerContainer	A										<section class="prog__container">Base class for listener container implementations which are based on polling. Provides support for listener handling based on MessageConsumer, optionally participating in externally managed transactions. This listener container variant is built for repeated polling attempts, each invoking the receiveAndExecute(java.lang.Object, javax.jms.Session, javax.jms.MessageConsumer) method. The MessageConsumer used may be reobtained fo reach attempt or cached in between attempts; this is up to the concrete implementation. The receive timeout for each attempt can be configured through the "receiveTimeout" property. The underlying mechanism is based on standard JMS MessageConsumer handling, which is perfectly compatible with both native JMS and JMS in a Java EE environment. Neither the JMS MessageConsumer.setMessageListener facility  nor the JMS ServerSessionPool facility is required. A further advantage of this approach is full control over the listening process, allowing for custom scaling and throttling and of concurrent message processing (which is up to concrete subclasses). Message reception and listener execution can automatically be wrapped in transactions through passing a Spring PlatformTransactionManager into the "transactionManager" property. This will usually be a JtaTransactionManager in a Java EE enviroment, in combination with a JTA-aware JMS ConnectionFactory obtained from JNDI (check your application server's documentation). This base class does not assume any specific mechanism for asynchronous execution of polling invokers. Check out DefaultMessageListenerContainer for a concrete implementation which is based on Spring's TaskExecutor abstraction, including dynamic scaling of concurrent consumers and automatic self recovery.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jms/listener/AbstractPollingMessageListenerContainer.html
DefaultMessageListenerContainer	A										<section class="prog__container">Message listener container variant that uses plain JMS client APIs, specifically a loop of MessageConsumer.receive() calls that also allow for transactional reception of messages (registering them with XA transactions). Designed to work in a native JMS environment as well as in a Java EE environment, with only minimal differences in configuration. This is a simple but nevertheless powerful form of message listener container. On startup, it obtains a fixed number of JMS Sessions to invoke the listener, and optionally allows for dynamic adaptation at runtime (up to a maximum number). Like SimpleMessageListenerContainer, its main advantage is its low level of runtime complexity, in particular the minimal requirements on the JMS provider: not even the JMS ServerSessionPool facility is required. Beyond that, it is fully self-recovering in case the broker is temporarily unavailable, and allows for stops/restarts as well as runtime changes to its configuration. Actual MessageListener execution happens in asynchronous work units which are created through Spring's TaskExecutor abstraction. By default, the specified number of invoker tasks will be created on startup, according to the "concurrentConsumers" setting. Specify an alternative TaskExecutor to integrate with an existing thread pool facility (such as a Java EE server's), for example using a CommonJ WorkManager. With a native JMS setup, each of those listener threads is going to use a cached JMS Session and MessageConsumer (only refreshed in case of failure), using the JMS provider's resources as efficiently as possible. Message reception and listener execution can automatically be wrapped in transactions by passing a Spring PlatformTransactionManager into the "transactionManager" property. This will usually be a JtaTransactionManager in a Java EE environment, in combination with a JTA-aware JMS ConnectionFactory obtained from JNDI (check your Java EE server's documentation). Note that this listener container will automatically reobtain all JMS handles for each transaction in case an external transaction manager is specified, for compatibility with all Java EE servers (in particular JBoss). This non-caching behavior can be overridden through the "cacheLevel" / "cacheLevelName" property, enforcing caching of the Connection (or also Session and MessageConsumer) even if an external transaction manager is involved. Dynamic scaling of the number of concurrent invokers can be activated by specifying a "maxConcurrentConsumers" value that is higher than the "concurrentConsumers" value. Since the latter's default is 1, you can also simply specify a "maxConcurrentConsumers" of e.g. 5, which will lead to dynamic scaling up to 5 concurrent consumers in case of increasing message load, as well as dynamic shrinking back to the standard number of consumers once the load decreases. Consider adapting the "idleTaskExecutionLimit" setting to control the lifespan of each new task, to avoid frequent scaling up and down, in particular if the ConnectionFactory does not pool JMS Sessions and/or the TaskExecutor does not pool threads (check your configuration!). Note that dynamic scaling only really makes sense for a queue in the first place; for a topic, you will typically stick with the default number of 1 consumer, otherwise you'd receive the same message multiple times on the same node. Note: Don't use Spring's CachingConnectionFactory in combination with dynamic scaling. Ideally, don't use it with a message listener container at all, since it is generally preferable to let the listener container itself handle appropriate caching within its lifecycle. Also, stopping and restarting a listener container will only work with an independent, locally cached Connection - not with an externally cached one. It is strongly recommended to either set "sessionTransacted" to "true" or specify an external "transactionManager". See the AbstractMessageListenerContainer javadoc for details on acknowledge modes and native transaction options, as well as the AbstractPollingMessageListenerContainer javadoc for details on configuring an external transaction manager. Note that for the default "AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE" mode, this container applies automatic message acknowledgment before listener execution, with no redelivery in case of an exception.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jms/listener/DefaultMessageListenerContainer.html

SimpleMessageListenerContainer	A										<section class="prog__container">Message listener container that uses the plain JMS client API's MessageConsumer.setMessageListener() method to create concurrent MessageConsumers for the specified listeners. This is the simplest form of a message listener container. It creates a fixed number of JMS Sessions to invoke the listener, not allowing for dynamic adaptation to runtime demands. Its main advantage is its low level of complexity and the minimum requirements on the JMS provider: Not even the ServerSessionPool facility is required. See the AbstractMessageListenerContainer javadoc for details on acknowledge modes and transaction options. Note that this container exposes standard JMS behavior for the default "AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE" mode: that is, automatic message acknowledgment after listener execution, with no redelivery in case of a user exception thrown but potential redelivery in case of the JVM dying during listener execution. For a different style of MessageListener handling, through looped MessageConsumer.receive() calls that also allow for transactional reception of messages (registering them with XA transactions), see DefaultMessageListenerContainer.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jms/listener/SimpleMessageListenerContainer.html

MessageListenerAdapter	A										<section class="prog__container">Message listener adapter that delegates the handling of messages to target listener methods via reflection, with flexible message type conversion. Allows listener methods to operate on message content types, completely independent from the JMS API. By default, the content of incoming JMS messages gets extracted before being passed into the target listener method, to let the target method operate on message content types such as String or byte array instead of the raw Message. Message type conversion is delegated to a Spring JMS MessageConverter. By default, a SimpleMessageConverter will be used. (If you do not want such automatic message conversion taking place, then be sure to set the MessageConverter to null.) If a target listener method returns a non-null object (typically of a message content type such as String or byte array), it will get wrapped in a JMS Message and sent to the response destination (either the JMS "reply-to" destination or a specified default destination). Note: The sending of response messages is only available when using the SessionAwareMessageListener entry point (typically through a Spring message listener container). Usage as standard JMS MessageListener does not support the generation of response messages. Find below some examples of method signatures compliant with this adapter class. This first example handles all Message types and gets passed the contents of each Message type as an argument. No Message will be sent back as all of these methods return void. public interface MessageContentsDelegate {    void handleMessage(String text);    void handleMessage(Map map);    void handleMessage(byte[] bytes);    void handleMessage(Serializable obj); } This next example handles all Message types and gets passed the actual (raw) Message as an argument. Again, no Message will be sent back as all of these methods return void. public interface RawMessageDelegate {    void handleMessage(TextMessage message);    void handleMessage(MapMessage message);    void handleMessage(BytesMessage message);    void handleMessage(ObjectMessage message); } This next example illustrates a Message delegate that just consumes the String contents of TextMessages. Notice also how the name of the Message handling method is different from the original (this will have to be configured in the attandant bean definition). Again, no Message will be sent back as the method returns void. public interface TextMessageContentDelegate {    void onMessage(String text); } This final example illustrates a Message delegate that just consumes the String contents of TextMessages. Notice how the return type of this method is String: This will result in the configured MessageListenerAdapter sending a TextMessage in response. public interface ResponsiveTextMessageContentDelegate {    String handleMessage(String text); } For further examples and discussion please do refer to the Spring reference documentation which describes this class (and it's attendant XML configuration) in detail.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jms/listener/adapter/MessageListenerAdapter.html

DefaultJmsActivationSpecFactory	A										<section class="prog__container">Default implementation of the JmsActivationSpecFactory interface. Supports the standard JMS properties as defined by the JCA 1.5 specification, as well as Spring's extended "maxConcurrency" and "prefetchSize" settings through autodetection of well-known vendor-specific provider properties. An ActivationSpec factory is effectively dependent on the concrete JMS provider, e.g. on ActiveMQ. This default implementation simply guesses the ActivationSpec class name from the provider's class name ("ActiveMQResourceAdapter" -> "ActiveMQActivationSpec" in the same package, or "ActivationSpecImpl" in the same package as the ResourceAdapter class), and populates the ActivationSpec properties as suggested by the JCA 1.5 specification (Appendix B). Specify the 'activationSpecClass' property explicitly if these default naming rules do not apply. Note: ActiveMQ, JORAM and WebSphere are supported in terms of extended settings (through the detection of their bean property naming conventions). The default ActivationSpec class detection rules may apply to other JMS providers as well.

JmsMessageEndpointFactory	A										<section class="prog__container">JMS-specific implementation of the JCA 1.5 MessageEndpointFactory interface, providing transaction management capabilities for a JMS listener object (e.g. a MessageListener object). Uses a static endpoint implementation, simply wrapping the specified message listener object and exposing all of its implemented interfaces on the endpoint instance. Typically used with Spring's JmsMessageEndpointManager, but not tied to it.

It does not support Spring's SessionAwareMessageListener variant, simply because the JCA endpoint management contract does not allow for obtaining the current JMS Session.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jms/listener/endpoint/JmsMessageEndpointManager.html
StandardJmsActivationSpecFactory	A										<section class="prog__container">Standard implementation of the JmsActivationSpecFactory interface. Supports the standard JMS properties as defined by the JMS 1.5 specification (Appendix B); ignores Spring's "maxConcurrency" and "prefetchSize" settings.

MBeanProxyFactoryBean	A										<section class="prog__container">Creates a proxy to a managed resource running either locally or remotely. The "proxyInterface" property defines the interface that the generated proxy is supposed to implement. This interface should define methods and properties that correspond to operations and attributes in the management interface of the resource you wish to proxy. There is no need for the managed resource to implement the proxy interface, although you may find it convenient to do. It is not required that every operation and attribute in the management interface is matched by a corresponding property or method in the proxy interface. Attempting to invoke or access any method or property on the proxy interface that does not correspond to the management interface will lead to an InvalidInvocationException.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jmx/access/MBeanProxyFactoryBean.html

MBeanExporter	A										<section class="prog__container">JMX exporter that allows for exposing any Spring-managed bean to a JMX MBeanServer, without the need to define any JMX-specific information in the bean classes. If a bean implements one of the JMX management interfaces, MBeanExporter can simply register the MBean with the server through its autodetection process. If a bean does not implement one of the JMX management interfaces, MBeanExporter will create the management information using the supplied MBeanInfoAssembler. A list of MBeanExporterListeners can be registered via the listeners property, allowing application code to be notified of MBean registration and unregistration events. This exporter is compatible with MBeans and MXBeans on Java 6 and above.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jmx/export/MBeanExporter.html

AbstractMBeanInfoAssembler	A										<section class="prog__container">Abstract implementation of the MBeanInfoAssembler interface that encapsulates the creation of a ModelMBeanInfo instance but delegates the creation of metadata to subclasses. This class offers two flavors of Class extraction from a managed bean instance: getTargetClass(java.lang.Object), extracting the target class behind any kind of AOP proxy, and getClassToExpose(java.lang.Object), returning the class or interface that will be searched for annotations and exposed to the JMX runtime.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jmx/export/assembler/AbstractMBeanInfoAssembler.html
AbstractReflectiveMBeanInfoAssembler	A										<section class="prog__container">Builds on the AbstractMBeanInfoAssembler superclass to add a basic algorithm for building metadata based on the reflective metadata of the MBean class. The logic for creating MBean metadata from the reflective metadata is contained in this class, but this class makes no decisions as to which methods and properties are to be exposed. Instead it gives subclasses a chance to 'vote' on each property or method through the includeXXX methods. Subclasses are also given the opportunity to populate attribute and operation metadata with additional descriptors once the metadata is assembled through the populateXXXDescriptor methods.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jmx/export/assembler/AbstractReflectiveMBeanInfoAssembler.html

MetadataNamingStrategy	A										<section class="prog__container">An implementation of the ObjectNamingStrategy interface that reads the ObjectName from the source-level metadata. Falls back to the bean key (bean name) if no ObjectName can be found in source-level metadata. Uses the JmxAttributeSource strategy interface, so that metadata can be read using any supported implementation. Out of the box, AnnotationJmxAttributeSource introspects a well-defined set of Java 5 annotations that come with Spring.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jmx/export/naming/MetadataNamingStrategy.html

ModelMBeanNotificationPublisher	A										<section class="prog__container">NotificationPublisher implementation that uses the infrastructure provided by the ModelMBean interface to track javax.management.NotificationListeners and send Notifications to those listeners.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jmx/export/notification/ModelMBeanNotificationPublisher.html
NotificationPublisher	A										<section class="prog__container">Simple interface allowing Spring-managed MBeans to publish JMX notifications without being aware of how those notifications are being transmitted to the MBeanServer. Managed resources can access a NotificationPublisher by implementing the NotificationPublisherAware interface. After a particular managed resource instance is registered with the MBeanServer, Spring will inject a NotificationPublisher instance into it if that resource implements the NotificationPublisherAware inteface. Each managed resource instance will have a distinct instance of a NotificationPublisher implementation. This instance will keep track of all the NotificationListeners registered for a particular mananaged resource. Any existing, user-defined MBeans should use standard JMX APIs for notification publication; this interface is intended for use only by Spring-created MBeans.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jmx/export/notification/NotificationPublisher.html
NotificationPublisherAware	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface to be implemented by any Spring-managed resource that is to be registered with an MBeanServer and wishes to send JMX javax.management.Notifications. Provides Spring-created managed resources with a NotificationPublisher as soon as they are registered with the MBeanServer. NOTE: This interface only applies to simple Spring-managed beans which happen to get exported through Spring's MBeanExporter. It does not apply to any non-exported beans; neither does it apply to standard MBeans exported by Spring. For standard JMX MBeans, consider implementing the ModelMBeanNotificationBroadcaster interface (or implementing a full ModelMBean).</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jmx/export/notification/NotificationPublisherAware.html
UnableToSendNotificationException	A										<section class="prog__container">Thrown when a JMX Notification is unable to be sent.

MBeanRegistrationSupport	A										<section class="prog__container">Provides supporting infrastructure for registering MBeans with an MBeanServer. The behavior when encountering an existing MBean at a given ObjectName is fully configurable allowing for flexible registration settings. All registered MBeans are tracked and can be unregistered by calling the #unregisterBeans() method. Sub-classes can receive notifications when an MBean is registered or unregistered by overriding the onRegister(ObjectName) and onUnregister(ObjectName) methods respectively. By default, the registration process will fail if attempting to register an MBean using a ObjectName that is already used. By setting the registrationPolicy property to RegistrationPolicy.IGNORE_EXISTING the registration process will simply ignore existing MBeans leaving them registered. This is useful in settings where multiple applications want to share a common MBean in a shared MBeanServer. Setting registrationPolicy property to RegistrationPolicy.REPLACE_EXISTING will cause existing MBeans to be replaced during registration if necessary. This is useful in situations where you can't guarantee the state of your MBeanServer.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jmx/support/MBeanRegistrationSupport.html
MBeanServerConnectionFactoryBean	A										<section class="prog__container">FactoryBean that creates a JMX 1.2 MBeanServerConnection to a remote MBeanServer exposed via a JMXServerConnector.

MBeanServerFactoryBean	A										<section class="prog__container">FactoryBean that obtains an MBeanServer reference through the standard JMX 1.2 MBeanServerFactory API (which is available on JDK 1.5 or as part of a JMX 1.2 provider). Exposes the MBeanServer for bean references. By default, MBeanServerFactoryBean will always create a new MBeanServer even if one is already running. To have the MBeanServerFactoryBean attempt to locate a running MBeanServer first, set the value of the "locateExistingServerIfPossible" property to "true".</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jmx/support/MBeanServerFactoryBean.html

JndiCallback	A										<section class="prog__container">Callback interface to be implemented by classes that need to perform an operation (such as a lookup) in a JNDI context. This callback approach is valuable in simplifying error handling, which is performed by the JndiTemplate class. This is a similar to JdbcTemplate's approach. Note that there is hardly any need to implement this callback interface, as JndiTemplate provides all usual JNDI operations via convenience methods.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jndi/JndiCallback.html
JndiLocatorDelegate	A										<section class="prog__container">JndiLocatorSupport subclass with public lookup methods, for convenient use as a delegate.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jndi/JndiLocatorDelegate.html
JndiLocatorSupport	A										<section class="prog__container">Convenient superclass for classes that can locate any number of JNDI objects. Derives from JndiAccessor to inherit the "jndiTemplate" and "jndiEnvironment" bean properties. JNDI names may or may not include the "java:comp/env/" prefix expected by J2EE applications when accessing a locally mapped (ENC - Environmental Naming Context) resource. If it doesn't, the "java:comp/env/" prefix will be prepended if the "resourceRef" property is true (the default is false) and no other scheme (e.g. "java:") is given.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jndi/JndiLocatorSupport.html
JndiLookupFailureException	A										<section class="prog__container">RuntimeException to be thrown in case of JNDI lookup failures, in particular from code that does not declare JNDI's checked NamingException: for example, from Spring's JndiObjectTargetSource.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jndi/JndiLookupFailureException.html
JndiObjectFactoryBean	A										<section class="prog__container">FactoryBean that looks up a JNDI object. Exposes the object found in JNDI for bean references, e.g. for data access object's "dataSource" property in case of a DataSource. The typical usage will be to register this as singleton factory (e.g. for a certain JNDI-bound DataSource) in an application context, and give bean references to application services that need it. The default behavior is to look up the JNDI object on startup and cache it. This can be customized through the "lookupOnStartup" and "cache" properties, using a JndiObjectTargetSource underneath. Note that you need to specify a "proxyInterface" in such a scenario, since the actual JNDI object type is not known in advance. Of course, bean classes in a Spring environment may lookup e.g. a DataSource from JNDI themselves. This class simply enables central configuration of the JNDI name, and easy switching to non-JNDI alternatives. The latter is particularly convenient for test setups, reuse in standalone clients, etc. Note that switching to e.g. DriverManagerDataSource is just a matter of configuration: Simply replace the definition of this FactoryBean with a DriverManagerDataSource definition!</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jndi/JndiObjectFactoryBean.html
JndiObjectLocator	A										<section class="prog__container">Convenient superclass for JNDI-based service locators, providing configurable lookup of a specific JNDI resource. Exposes a "jndiName" property. This may or may not include the "java:comp/env/" prefix expected by J2EE applications when accessing a locally mapped (Environmental Naming Context) resource. If it doesn't, the "java:comp/env/" prefix will be prepended if the "resourceRef" property is true (the default is false) and no other scheme (e.g. "java:") is given. Subclasses may invoke the lookup() method whenever it is appropriate. Some classes might do this on initialization, while others might do it on demand. The latter strategy is more flexible in that it allows for initialization of the locator before the JNDI object is available.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jndi/JndiObjectLocator.html
JndiObjectTargetSource	A										<section class="prog__container">AOP TargetSource that provides configurable JNDI lookups for getTarget() calls. Can be used as alternative to JndiObjectFactoryBean, to allow for relocating a JNDI object lazily or for each operation (see "lookupOnStartup" and "cache" properties). This is particularly useful during development, as it allows for hot restarting of the JNDI server (for example, a remote JMS server). Example:  <bean id="queueConnectionFactoryTarget" class="org.springframework.jndi.JndiObjectTargetSource">   <property name="jndiName" value="JmsQueueConnectionFactory"/>   <property name="lookupOnStartup" value="false"/> </bean> <bean id="queueConnectionFactory" class="org.springframework.aop.framework.ProxyFactoryBean">   <property name="proxyInterfaces" value="javax.jms.QueueConnectionFactory"/>   <property name="targetSource" ref="queueConnectionFactoryTarget"/> </bean> A createQueueConnection call on the "queueConnectionFactory" proxy will cause a lazy JNDI lookup for "JmsQueueConnectionFactory" and a subsequent delegating call to the retrieved QueueConnectionFactory's createQueueConnection. Alternatively, use a JndiObjectFactoryBean with a "proxyInterface". "lookupOnStartup" and "cache" can then be specified on the JndiObjectFactoryBean, creating a JndiObjectTargetSource underneath (instead of defining separate ProxyFactoryBean and JndiObjectTargetSource beans).</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jndi/JndiObjectTargetSource.html
JndiPropertySource	A										<section class="prog__container">PropertySource implementation that reads properties from an underlying Spring JndiLocatorDelegate. By default, the underlying JndiLocatorDelegate will be configured with its "resourceRef" property set to true, meaning that names looked up will automatically be prefixed with "java:comp/env/" in alignment with published JNDI naming conventions. To override this setting or to change the prefix, manually configure a JndiLocatorDelegate and provide it to one of the constructors here that accepts it. The same applies when providing custom JNDI properties. These should be specified using JndiAccessor.setJndiEnvironment(java.util.Properties) prior to construction of the JndiPropertySource. Note that StandardServletEnvironment includes a JndiPropertySource by default, and any customization of the underlying JndiLocatorDelegate may be performed within an ApplicationContextInitializer or WebApplicationInitializer.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jndi/JndiPropertySource.html
JndiTemplate	A										<section class="prog__container">Helper class that simplifies JNDI operations.

Thrown by JndiTemplate.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jndi/TypeMismatchNamingException.html
SimpleJndiBeanFactory	A										<section class="prog__container">Simple JNDI-based implementation of Spring's BeanFactory interface. Does not support enumerating bean definitions, hence doesn't implement the ListableBeanFactory interface. This factory resolves given bean names as JNDI names within the J2EE application's "java:comp/env/" namespace. It caches the resolved types for all obtained objects, and optionally also caches shareable objects (if they are explicitly marked as shareable resource. The main intent of this factory is usage in combination with Spring's CommonAnnotationBeanPostProcessor, configured as "resourceFactory" for resolving @Resource annotations as JNDI objects without intermediate bean definitions. It may be used for similar lookup scenarios as well, of course, in particular if BeanFactory-style type checking is required.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jndi/support/SimpleJndiBeanFactory.html

MailMessage	A										<section class="prog__container">This is a common interface for mail messages, allowing a user to set key values required in assembling a mail message, without needing to know if the underlying message is a simple text message or a more sophisticated MIME message. Implemented by both SimpleMailMessage and MimeMessageHelper, to let message population code interact with a simple message or a MIME message through a common interface.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/mail/MailMessage.html
MailParseException	A										<section class="prog__container">Exception thrown if illegal message properties are encountered.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/mail/MailParseException.html

MailSender	A										<section class="prog__container">This interface defines a strategy for sending simple mails. Can be implemented for a variety of mailing systems due to the simple requirements. For richer functionality like MIME messages, consider JavaMailSender. Allows for easy testing of clients, as it does not depend on JavaMail's infrastructure classes: no mocking of JavaMail Session or Transport necessary.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/mail/MailSender.html
MailSendException	A										<section class="prog__container">Exception thrown when a mail sending error is encountered. Can register failed messages with their exceptions.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/mail/MailSendException.html
SimpleMailMessage	A										<section class="prog__container">Models a simple mail message, including data such as the from, to, cc, subject, and text fields. Consider JavaMailSender and JavaMail MimeMessages for creating more sophisticated messages, for example messages with attachments, special character encodings, or personal names that accompany mail addresses.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/mail/SimpleMailMessage.html
ConfigurableMimeFileTypeMap	A										<section class="prog__container">Spring-configurable FileTypeMap implementation that will read MIME type to file extension mappings from a standard JavaMail MIME type mapping file, using a standard MimetypesFileTypeMap underneath. The mapping file should be in the following format, as specified by the Java Activation Framework:  # map text/html to .htm and .html files text/html  html htm HTML HTM Lines starting with # are treated as comments and are ignored. All other lines are treated as mappings. Each mapping line should contain the MIME type as the first entry and then each file extension to map to that MIME type as subsequent entries. Each entry is separated by spaces or tabs. By default, the mappings in the mime.types file located in the same package as this class are used, which cover many common file extensions (in contrast to the out-of-the-box mappings in activation.jar). This can be overridden using the mappingLocation property. Additional mappings can be added via the mappings bean property, as lines that follow the mime.types file format.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/mail/javamail/ConfigurableMimeFileTypeMap.html
InternetAddressEditor	A										<section class="prog__container">Editor for java.mail.internet.InternetAddress, to directly populate an InternetAddress property. Expects the same syntax as InternetAddress's constructor with a String argument. Converts empty Strings into null values.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/mail/javamail/InternetAddressEditor.html
JavaMailSender	A										<section class="prog__container">Extended MailSender interface for JavaMail, supporting MIME messages both as direct arguments and through preparation callbacks. Typically used in conjunction with the MimeMessageHelper class for convenient creation of JavaMail MimeMessages, including attachments etc. Clients should talk to the mail sender through this interface if they need mail functionality beyond SimpleMailMessage. The production implementation is JavaMailSenderImpl; for testing, mocks can be created based on this interface. Clients will typically receive the JavaMailSender reference through dependency injection. The recommended way of using this interface is the MimeMessagePreparator mechanism, possibly using a MimeMessageHelper for populating the message. See MimeMessageHelper's javadoc for an example. The entire JavaMail Session management is abstracted by the JavaMailSender. Client code should not deal with a Session in any way, rather leave the entire JavaMail configuration and resource handling to the JavaMailSender implementation. This also increases testability. A JavaMailSender client is not as easy to test as a plain MailSender client, but still straightforward compared to traditional JavaMail code: Just let createMimeMessage() return a plain MimeMessage created with a Session.getInstance(new Properties()) call, and check the passed-in messages in your mock implementations of the various send methods.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/mail/javamail/JavaMailSender.html
JavaMailSenderImpl	A										<section class="prog__container">Production implementation of the JavaMailSender interface, supporting both JavaMail MimeMessages and Spring SimpleMailMessages. Can also be used as a plain MailSender implementation. Allows for defining all settings locally as bean properties. Alternatively, a pre-configured JavaMail Session can be specified, possibly pulled from an application server's JNDI environment. Non-default properties in this object will always override the settings in the JavaMail Session. Note that if overriding all values locally, there is no added value in setting a pre-configured Session.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/mail/javamail/JavaMailSenderImpl.html
MimeMailMessage	A										<section class="prog__container">Implementation of the MailMessage interface for a JavaMail MIME message, to let message population code interact with a simple message or a MIME message through a common interface. Uses a MimeMessageHelper underneath. Can either be created with a MimeMessageHelper instance or with a JavaMail MimeMessage instance.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/mail/javamail/MimeMailMessage.html
MimeMessageHelper	A										<section class="prog__container">Helper class for populating a MimeMessage. Mirrors the simple setters of SimpleMailMessage, directly applying the values to the underlying MimeMessage. Allows for defining a character encoding for the entire message, automatically applied by all methods of this helper class. Offers support for HTML text content, inline elements such as images, and typical mail attachments. Also supports personal names that accompany mail addresses. Note that advanced settings can still be applied directly to the underlying MimeMessage object! Typically used in MimeMessagePreparator implementations or JavaMailSender client code: simply instantiating it as a MimeMessage wrapper, invoking setters on the wrapper, using the underlying MimeMessage for mail sending. Also used internally by JavaMailSenderImpl. Sample code for an HTML mail with an inline image and a PDF attachment:  mailSender.send(new MimeMessagePreparator() {   public void prepare(MimeMessage mimeMessage) throws MessagingException {     MimeMessageHelper message = new MimeMessageHelper(mimeMessage, true, "UTF-8");     message.setFrom("me@mail.com");     message.setTo("you@mail.com");     message.setSubject("my subject");     message.setText("my text <img src='cid:myLogo'>", true);     message.addInline("myLogo", new ClassPathResource("img/mylogo.gif"));     message.addAttachment("myDocument.pdf", new ClassPathResource("doc/myDocument.pdf"));   } }); Consider using MimeMailMessage (which implements the common MailMessage interface, just like SimpleMailMessage) on top of this helper, in order to let message population code interact with a simple message or a MIME message through a common interface. Warning regarding multipart mails: Simple MIME messages that just contain HTML text but no inline elements or attachments will work on more or less any email client that is capable of HTML rendering. However, inline elements and attachments are still a major compatibility issue between email clients: It's virtually impossible to get inline elements and attachments working across Microsoft Outlook, Lotus Notes and Mac Mail. Consider choosing a specific multipart mode for your needs: The javadoc on the MULTIPART_MODE constants contains more detailed information.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/mail/javamail/MimeMessageHelper.html
MimeMessagePreparator	A										<section class="prog__container">Callback interface for the preparation of JavaMail MIME messages. The corresponding send methods of JavaMailSender will take care of the actual creation of a MimeMessage instance, and of proper exception conversion. It is often convenient to use a MimeMessageHelper for populating the passed-in MimeMessage, in particular when working with attachments or special character encodings. See MimeMessageHelper's javadoc for an example.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/mail/javamail/MimeMessagePreparator.html

Any mutating operation such as put(..), putAll(..) and others will throw UnsupportedOperationException. Subclasses do have access to the raw headers, however, via getRawHeaders(). One way to create message headers is to use the MessageBuilder:  MessageBuilder.withPayload("foo").setHeader("key1", "value1").setHeader("key2", "value2");  A second option is to create GenericMessage passing a payload as Object and headers as a java.util.Map:  Map headers = new HashMap(); headers.put("key1", "value1"); headers.put("key2", "value2"); new GenericMessage("foo", headers);  A third option is to use MessageHeaderAccessor or one of its subclasses to create specific categories of headers.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/messaging/MessageHeaders.html

MessageMapping	A										<section class="prog__container">Annotation for mapping a Message onto message-handling methods by matching to the message destination. This annotation can also be used on the type-level in which case it defines a common destination prefix or pattern for all method-level annotations including method-level @SubscribeMapping annotations. Handler methods which are annotated with this annotation are allowed to have flexible signatures. They may have arguments of the following types, in arbitrary order: Message to get access to the complete message being processed.Payload-annotated method arguments to extract the payload of a message and optionally convert it using a MessageConverter. The presence of the annotation is not required since it is assumed by default for method arguments that are not annotated. Payload method arguments annotated with Validation annotations (like Validated) will be subject to JSR-303 validation.Header-annotated method arguments to extract a specific header value along with type conversion with a Converter if necessary.Headers-annotated argument that must also be assignable to Map for getting access to all headers.MessageHeaders arguments for getting access to all headers.MessageHeaderAccessor or with STOMP over WebSocket support also sub-classes such as SimpMessageHeaderAccessor for convenient access to all method arguments.DestinationVariable-annotated arguments for access to template variable values extracted from the message destination (e.g. /hotels/{hotel}). Variable values will be converted to the declared method argument type.Principal method arguments are supported with STOMP over WebSocket messages. It reflects the user logged in to the WebSocket session on which the message was received. Regular HTTP-based authentication (e.g. Spring Security based) can be used to secure the HTTP handshake that initiates WebSocket sessions.By default the return value is wrapped as a message and sent to the destination specified with an @SendTo method-level annotation. STOMP over WebSocketAn @SendTo annotation is not strictly required — by default the message will be sent to the same destination as the incoming message but with an additional prefix ("/topic" by default). It is also possible to use the SendToUser annotation to have the message directed to a specific user if connected. The return value is converted with a MessageConverter.

SubscribeMapping	A										<section class="prog__container">Annotation for mapping subscription messages onto specific handler methods based on the destination of a subscription. Supported with STOMP over WebSocket only (e.g. STOMP SUBSCRIBE frame). This is a method-level annotation that can be combined with a type-level @MessageMapping. Supports the same method arguments as @MessageMapping; however, subscription messages typically do not have a body. The return value also follows the same rules as for @MessageMapping, except if the method is not annotated with SendTo or SendToUser, the message is sent directly back to the connected user and does not pass through the message broker. This is useful for implementing a request-reply pattern.

SubscriptionMethodReturnValueHandler	A										<section class="prog__container">HandlerMethodReturnValueHandler for replying directly to a subscription. It is supported on methods annotated with SubscribeMapping such that the return value is treated as a response to be sent directly back on the session. This allows a client to implement a request-response pattern and use it for example to obtain some data upon initialization. The value returned from the method is converted and turned into a Message that is then enriched with the sessionId, subscriptionId, and destination of the input message. Note: this default behavior for interpreting the return value from an @SubscribeMapping method can be overridden through use of the SendTo or SendToUser annotations in which case a message is prepared and sent to the broker instead.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/messaging/simp/annotation/support/SubscriptionMethodReturnValueHandler.html

A single instance of this decoder can be invoked repeatedly to read all messages from a single stream (e.g. WebSocket session) as long as decoding does not fail. If there is an exception, StompDecoder instance should not be used any more as its internal state is not guaranteed to be consistent. It is expected that the underlying session is closed at that point.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/messaging/simp/stomp/BufferingStompDecoder.html

StompBrokerRelayMessageHandler	A										<section class="prog__container">A MessageHandler that handles messages by forwarding them to a STOMP broker. For each new CONNECT message, an independent TCP connection to the broker is opened and used exclusively for all messages from the client that originated the CONNECT message. Messages from the same client are identified through the session id message header. Reversely, when the STOMP broker sends messages back on the TCP connection, those messages are enriched with the session id of the client and sent back downstream through the MessageChannel provided to the constructor. This class also automatically opens a default "system" TCP connection to the message broker that is used for sending messages that originate from the server application (as opposed to from a client). Such messages are not associated with any client and therefore do not have a session id header. The "system" connection is effectively shared and cannot be used to receive messages. Several properties are provided to configure the "system" connection including: setSystemLogin(String)setSystemPasscode(String)setSystemHeartbeatSendInterval(long)setSystemHeartbeatReceiveInterval(long)</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/messaging/simp/stomp/StompBrokerRelayMessageHandler.html

When created from STOMP frame content, the actual STOMP headers are stored in the native header sub-map managed by the parent class NativeMessageHeaderAccessor while the parent class SimpMessageHeaderAccessor manages common processing headers some of which are based on STOMP headers (e.g. destination, content-type, etc). An instance of this class can also be created by wrapping an existing Message. That message may have been created with the more generic SimpMessageHeaderAccessor in which case STOMP headers are created from common processing headers. In this case it is also necessary to invoke either updateStompCommandAsClientMessage() or updateStompCommandAsServerMessage() if sending a message and depending on whether a message is sent to a client or the message broker.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/messaging/simp/stomp/StompHeaderAccessor.html

MessageHeaderAccessor	A										<section class="prog__container">A base for classes providing strongly typed getters and setters as well as behavior around specific categories of headers (e.g. STOMP headers). Supports creating new headers, modifying existing headers (when still mutable), or copying and modifying existing headers. The method getMessageHeaders() provides access to the underlying, fully-prepared MessageHeaders that can then be used as-is (i.e. without copying) to create a single message as follows:  MessageHeaderAccessor accessor = new MessageHeaderAccessor(); accessor.setHeader("foo", "bar"); Message message = MessageBuilder.createMessage("payload", accessor.getMessageHeaders()); After the above, by default the MessageHeaderAccessor becomes immutable. However it is possible to leave it mutable for further initialization in the same thread, for example:  MessageHeaderAccessor accessor = new MessageHeaderAccessor(); accessor.setHeader("foo", "bar"); accessor.setLeaveMutable(true); Message message = MessageBuilder.createMessage("payload", accessor.getMessageHeaders()); // later on in the same thread... MessageHeaderAccessor accessor = MessageHeaderAccessor.getAccessor(message); accessor.setHeader("bar", "baz"); accessor.setImmutable(); The method toMap() returns a copy of the underlying headers. It can be used to prepare multiple messages from the same MessageHeaderAccessor instance:  MessageHeaderAccessor accessor = new MessageHeaderAccessor(); MessageBuilder builder = MessageBuilder.withPayload("payload").setHeaders(accessor); accessor.setHeader("foo", "bar1"); Message message1 = builder.build(); accessor.setHeader("foo", "bar2"); Message message2 = builder.build(); accessor.setHeader("foo", "bar3"); Message  message3 = builder.build(); However note that with the above style, the header accessor is shared and cannot be re-obtained later on. Alternatively it is also possible to create one MessageHeaderAccessor per message:  MessageHeaderAccessor accessor1 = new MessageHeaderAccessor(); accessor.set("foo", "bar1"); Message message1 = MessageBuilder.createMessage("payload", accessor1.getMessageHeaders()); MessageHeaderAccessor accessor2 = new MessageHeaderAccessor(); accessor.set("foo", "bar2"); Message message2 = MessageBuilder.createMessage("payload", accessor2.getMessageHeaders()); MessageHeaderAccessor accessor3 = new MessageHeaderAccessor(); accessor.set("foo", "bar3"); Message message3 = MessageBuilder.createMessage("payload", accessor3.getMessageHeaders()); Note that the above examples aim to demonstrate the general idea of using header accessors. The most likely usage however is through subclasses.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/messaging/support/MessageHeaderAccessor.html

NativeMessageHeaderAccessor	A										<section class="prog__container">An extension of MessageHeaderAccessor that also stores and provides read/write access to message headers from an external source -- e.g. a Spring Message created to represent a STOMP message received from a STOMP client or message broker. Native message headers are kept in a Map<String, List<String>> under the key NATIVE_HEADERS. This class is not intended for direct use but is rather expected to be used indirectly through protocol-specific sub-classes such as StompHeaderAccessor. Such sub-classes may provide factory methods to translate message headers from an external messaging source (e.g. STOMP) to Spring Message headers and reversely to translate Spring Message headers to a message to send to an external source.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/messaging/support/NativeMessageHeaderAccessor.html

This class is not intended for direct usage by applications, although it can be used for example to override JndiTemplate's createInitialContext method in unit tests. Typically, SimpleNamingContextBuilder will be used to set up a JVM-level JNDI environment.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/mock/jndi/SimpleNamingContext.html
SimpleNamingContextBuilder	A										<section class="prog__container">Simple implementation of a JNDI naming context builder. Mainly targeted at test environments, where each test case can configure JNDI appropriately, so that new InitialContext() will expose the required objects. Also usable for standalone applications, e.g. for binding a JDBC DataSource to a well-known JNDI location, to be able to use traditional J2EE data access code outside of a J2EE container. There are various choices for DataSource implementations: SingleConnectionDataSource (using the same Connection for all getConnection calls) DriverManagerDataSource (creating a new Connection on each getConnection call) Apache's Commons DBCP offers org.apache.commons.dbcp.BasicDataSource (a real pool) Typical usage in bootstrap code:  SimpleNamingContextBuilder builder = new SimpleNamingContextBuilder(); DataSource ds = new DriverManagerDataSource(...); builder.bind("java:comp/env/jdbc/myds", ds); builder.activate(); Note that it's impossible to activate multiple builders within the same JVM, due to JNDI restrictions. Thus to configure a fresh builder repeatedly, use the following code to get a reference to either an already activated builder or a newly activated one:  SimpleNamingContextBuilder builder = SimpleNamingContextBuilder.emptyActivatedContextBuilder(); DataSource ds = new DriverManagerDataSource(...); builder.bind("java:comp/env/jdbc/myds", ds); Note that you should not call activate() on a builder from this factory method, as there will already be an activated one in any case. An instance of this class is only necessary at setup time. An application does not need to keep a reference to it after activation.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/mock/jndi/SimpleNamingContextBuilder.html

MockServletContext	A										<section class="prog__container">Mock implementation of the ServletContext interface. As of Spring 4.0, this set of mocks is designed on a Servlet 3.0 baseline. Compatible with Servlet 3.0 but can be configured to expose a specific version through setMajorVersion(int)/setMinorVersion(int); default is 3.0. Note that Servlet 3.0 support is limited: servlet, filter and listener registration methods are not supported; neither is JSP configuration. We generally do not recommend to unit test your ServletContainerInitializers and WebApplicationInitializers which is where those registration methods would be used. Used for testing the Spring web framework; only rarely necessary for testing application controllers. As long as application components don't explicitly access the ServletContext, ClassPathXmlApplicationContext or FileSystemXmlApplicationContext can be used to load the context files for testing, even for DispatcherServlet context definitions. For setting up a full WebApplicationContext in a test environment, you can use AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext, XmlWebApplicationContext, or GenericWebApplicationContext, passing in an appropriate MockServletContext instance. You might want to configure your MockServletContext with a FileSystemResourceLoader in that case to ensure that resource paths are interpreted as relative filesystem locations. A common setup is to point your JVM working directory to the root of your web application directory, in combination with filesystem-based resource loading. This allows to load the context files as used in the web application, with relative paths getting interpreted correctly. Such a setup will work with both FileSystemXmlApplicationContext (which will load straight from the filesystem) and XmlWebApplicationContext with an underlying MockServletContext (as long as the MockServletContext has been configured with a FileSystemResourceLoader).</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/mock/web/MockServletContext.html

HibernateTemplate	A										<section class="prog__container">Helper class that simplifies Hibernate data access code. Automatically converts HibernateExceptions into DataAccessExceptions, following the org.springframework.dao exception hierarchy. The central method is execute, supporting Hibernate access code implementing the HibernateCallback interface. It provides Hibernate Session handling such that neither the HibernateCallback implementation nor the calling code needs to explicitly care about retrieving/closing Hibernate Sessions, or handling Session lifecycle exceptions. For typical single step actions, there are various convenience methods (find, load, saveOrUpdate, delete). Can be used within a service implementation via direct instantiation with a SessionFactory reference, or get prepared in an application context and given to services as bean reference. Note: The SessionFactory should always be configured as bean in the application context, in the first case given to the service directly, in the second case to the prepared template. NOTE: Hibernate access code can also be coded in plain Hibernate style. Hence, for newly started projects, consider adopting the standard Hibernate style of coding data access objects instead, based on SessionFactory.getCurrentSession(). This HibernateTemplate primarily exists as a migration helper for Hibernate 3 based data access code, to benefit from bug fixes in Hibernate 4.x.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/orm/hibernate4/HibernateTemplate.html
HibernateTransactionManager	A										<section class="prog__container">PlatformTransactionManager implementation for a single Hibernate SessionFactory. Binds a Hibernate Session from the specified factory to the thread, potentially allowing for one thread-bound Session per factory. SessionFactory.getCurrentSession() is required for Hibernate access code that needs to support this transaction handling mechanism, with the SessionFactory being configured with SpringSessionContext. Supports custom isolation levels, and timeouts that get applied as Hibernate transaction timeouts. This transaction manager is appropriate for applications that use a single Hibernate SessionFactory for transactional data access, but it also supports direct DataSource access within a transaction (i.e. plain JDBC code working with the same DataSource). This allows for mixing services which access Hibernate and services which use plain JDBC (without being aware of Hibernate)! Application code needs to stick to the same simple Connection lookup pattern as with DataSourceTransactionManager (i.e. DataSourceUtils.getConnection(javax.sql.DataSource) or going through a TransactionAwareDataSourceProxy). Note: To be able to register a DataSource's Connection for plain JDBC code, this instance needs to be aware of the DataSource (setDataSource(javax.sql.DataSource)). The given DataSource should obviously match the one used by the given SessionFactory. JTA (usually through JtaTransactionManager) is necessary for accessing multiple transactional resources within the same transaction. The DataSource that Hibernate uses needs to be JTA-enabled in such a scenario (see container setup). This transaction manager supports nested transactions via JDBC 3.0 Savepoints. The AbstractPlatformTransactionManager.setNestedTransactionAllowed(boolean) "nestedTransactionAllowed"} flag defaults to "false", though, as nested transactions will just apply to the JDBC Connection, not to the Hibernate Session and its cached entity objects and related context. You can manually set the flag to "true" if you want to use nested transactions for JDBC access code which participates in Hibernate transactions (provided that your JDBC driver supports Savepoints). Note that Hibernate itself does not support nested transactions! Hence, do not expect Hibernate access code to semantically participate in a nested transaction.NOTE: Hibernate 4.2+ is strongly recommended for efficient transaction management with Spring, in particular for transactional Spring JDBC access.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/orm/hibernate4/HibernateTransactionManager.html
LocalSessionFactoryBean	A										<section class="prog__container">FactoryBean that creates a Hibernate SessionFactory. This is the usual way to set up a shared Hibernate SessionFactory in a Spring application context; the SessionFactory can then be passed to Hibernate-based data access objects via dependency injection. This variant of LocalSessionFactoryBean requires Hibernate 4.0 or higher. As of Spring 4.0, it is compatible with (the quite refactored) Hibernate 4.3 as well. We recommend using the latest Hibernate 4.2.x or 4.3.x version, depending on whether you need to remain JPA 2.0 compatible at runtime (Hibernate 4.2) or can upgrade to JPA 2.1 (Hibernate 4.3). This class is similar in role to the same-named class in the orm.hibernate3 package. However, in practice, it is closer to AnnotationSessionFactoryBean since its core purpose is to bootstrap a SessionFactory from package scanning. NOTE: To set up Hibernate 4 for Spring-driven JTA transactions, make sure to either specify the "jtaTransactionManager" bean property or to set the "hibernate.transaction.factory_class" property to CMTTransactionFactory. Otherwise, Hibernate's smart flushing mechanism won't work properly.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/orm/hibernate4/LocalSessionFactoryBean.html
LocalSessionFactoryBuilder	A										<section class="prog__container">A Spring-provided extension of the standard Hibernate Configuration class, adding SpringSessionContext as a default and providing convenient ways to specify a DataSource and an application class loader. This is designed for programmatic use, e.g. in @Bean factory methods. Consider using LocalSessionFactoryBean for XML bean definition files. Requires Hibernate 4.0 or higher. As of Spring 4.0, it is compatible with (the quite refactored) Hibernate 4.3 as well. We recommend using the latest Hibernate 4.2.x or 4.3.x version, depending on whether you need to remain JPA 2.0 compatible at runtime (Hibernate 4.2) or can upgrade to JPA 2.1 (Hibernate 4.3). NOTE: To set up Hibernate 4 for Spring-driven JTA transactions, make sure to either use the setJtaTransactionManager(java.lang.Object) method or to set the "hibernate.transaction.factory_class" property to CMTTransactionFactory. Otherwise, Hibernate's smart flushing mechanism won't work properly.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/orm/hibernate4/LocalSessionFactoryBuilder.html

HibernateDaoSupport	A										<section class="prog__container">Convenient super class for Hibernate-based data access objects. Requires a SessionFactory to be set, providing a HibernateTemplate based on it to subclasses through the getHibernateTemplate() method. Can alternatively be initialized directly with a HibernateTemplate, in order to reuse the latter's settings such as the SessionFactory, exception translator, flush mode, etc. This class will create its own HibernateTemplate instance if a SessionFactory is passed in. The "allowCreate" flag on that HibernateTemplate will be "true" by default. A custom HibernateTemplate instance can be used through overriding createHibernateTemplate(org.hibernate.SessionFactory). NOTE: Hibernate access code can also be coded in plain Hibernate style. Hence, for newly started projects, consider adopting the standard Hibernate style of coding data access objects instead, based on SessionFactory.getCurrentSession(). This HibernateTemplate primarily exists as a migration helper for Hibernate 3 based data access code, to benefit from bug fixes in Hibernate 4.x.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/orm/hibernate4/support/HibernateDaoSupport.html
OpenSessionInterceptor	A										<section class="prog__container">Simple AOP Alliance MethodInterceptor implementation that binds a new Hibernate Session for each method invocation, if none bound before.

OpenSessionInViewFilter	A										<section class="prog__container">Servlet Filter that binds a Hibernate Session to the thread for the entire processing of the request. Intended for the "Open Session in View" pattern, i.e. to allow for lazy loading in web views despite the original transactions already being completed. This filter makes Hibernate Sessions available via the current thread, which will be autodetected by transaction managers. It is suitable for service layer transactions via HibernateTransactionManager as well as for non-transactional execution (if configured appropriately). NOTE: This filter will by default not flush the Hibernate Session, with the flush mode set to FlushMode.NEVER. It assumes to be used in combination with service layer transactions that care for the flushing: The active transaction manager will temporarily change the flush mode to FlushMode.AUTO during a read-write transaction, with the flush mode reset to FlushMode.NEVER at the end of each transaction. WARNING: Applying this filter to existing logic can cause issues that have not appeared before, through the use of a single Hibernate Session for the processing of an entire request. In particular, the reassociation of persistent objects with a Hibernate Session has to occur at the very beginning of request processing, to avoid clashes with already loaded instances of the same objects. Looks up the SessionFactory in Spring's root web application context. Supports a "sessionFactoryBeanName" filter init-param in web.xml; the default bean name is "sessionFactory".</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/orm/hibernate4/support/OpenSessionInViewFilter.html

It is suitable for service layer transactions via HibernateTransactionManager as well as for non-transactional execution (if configured appropriately). In contrast to OpenSessionInViewFilter, this interceptor is configured in a Spring application context and can thus take advantage of bean wiring.

HibernateTransactionManager	A										<section class="prog__container">PlatformTransactionManager implementation for a single Hibernate SessionFactory. Binds a Hibernate Session from the specified factory to the thread, potentially allowing for one thread-bound Session per factory. SessionFactory.getCurrentSession() is required for Hibernate access code that needs to support this transaction handling mechanism, with the SessionFactory being configured with SpringSessionContext. Supports custom isolation levels, and timeouts that get applied as Hibernate transaction timeouts. This transaction manager is appropriate for applications that use a single Hibernate SessionFactory for transactional data access, but it also supports direct DataSource access within a transaction (i.e. plain JDBC code working with the same DataSource). This allows for mixing services which access Hibernate and services which use plain JDBC (without being aware of Hibernate)! Application code needs to stick to the same simple Connection lookup pattern as with DataSourceTransactionManager (i.e. DataSourceUtils.getConnection(javax.sql.DataSource) or going through a TransactionAwareDataSourceProxy). Note: To be able to register a DataSource's Connection for plain JDBC code, this instance needs to be aware of the DataSource (setDataSource(javax.sql.DataSource)). The given DataSource should obviously match the one used by the given SessionFactory. JTA (usually through JtaTransactionManager) is necessary for accessing multiple transactional resources within the same transaction. The DataSource that Hibernate uses needs to be JTA-enabled in such a scenario (see container setup). This transaction manager supports nested transactions via JDBC 3.0 Savepoints. The AbstractPlatformTransactionManager.setNestedTransactionAllowed(boolean) "nestedTransactionAllowed"} flag defaults to "false", though, as nested transactions will just apply to the JDBC Connection, not to the Hibernate Session and its cached entity objects and related context. You can manually set the flag to "true" if you want to use nested transactions for JDBC access code which participates in Hibernate transactions (provided that your JDBC driver supports Savepoints). Note that Hibernate itself does not support nested transactions! Hence, do not expect Hibernate access code to semantically participate in a nested transaction.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/orm/hibernate5/HibernateTransactionManager.html

DefaultJdoDialect	A										<section class="prog__container">Default implementation of the JdoDialect interface. As of Spring 4.0, designed for JDO 3.0 (or rather, semantics beyond JDO 3.0). Used as default dialect by JdoTransactionManager. Simply begins a standard JDO transaction in beginTransaction. Returns a handle for a JDO DataStoreConnection on getJdbcConnection. Calls the corresponding JDO PersistenceManager operation on flush Uses a Spring SQLExceptionTranslator for exception translation, if applicable. Note that, even with JDO 3.0, vendor-specific subclasses are still necessary for special transaction semantics and more sophisticated exception translation. Furthermore, vendor-specific subclasses are encouraged to expose the native JDBC Connection on getJdbcConnection, rather than JDO 3.0's wrapper handle. This class also implements the PersistenceExceptionTranslator interface, as autodetected by Spring's PersistenceExceptionTranslationPostProcessor, for AOP-based translation of native exceptions to Spring DataAccessExceptions.

LocalPersistenceManagerFactoryBean	A										<section class="prog__container">FactoryBean that creates a JDO PersistenceManagerFactory. This is the usual way to set up a shared JDO PersistenceManagerFactory in a Spring application context; the PersistenceManagerFactory can then be passed to JDO-based DAOs via dependency injection. Note that switching to a JNDI lookup or to a bean-style PersistenceManagerFactory instance is just a matter of configuration! NOTE: This class requires JDO 3.0 or higher, as of Spring 4.0. It will also expose the JPA EntityManagerFactory as long as the JDO provider creates a javax.jdo.JDOEntityManagerFactory reference underneath, which means that this class can be used as a replacement for LocalEntityManagerFactoryBean in such a scenario. Configuration settings can either be read from a properties file, specified as "configLocation", or locally specified. Properties specified as "jdoProperties" here will override any settings in a file. You may alternatively specify a "persistenceManagerFactoryName", referring to a PMF definition in "META-INF/jdoconfig.xml" (see setPersistenceManagerFactoryName(java.lang.String)). This class also implements the PersistenceExceptionTranslator interface, as autodetected by Spring's PersistenceExceptionTranslationPostProcessor, for AOP-based translation of native exceptions to Spring DataAccessExceptions. Hence, the presence of a LocalPersistenceManagerFactoryBean automatically enables a PersistenceExceptionTranslationPostProcessor to translate JDO exceptions. Alternative: Configuration of a PersistenceManagerFactory provider beanAs alternative to the properties-driven approach that this FactoryBean offers (which is analogous to using the standard JDOHelper class with a Properties object that is populated with standard JDO properties), you can set up an instance of your PersistenceManagerFactory implementation class directly. Like a DataSource, a PersistenceManagerFactory is encouraged to support bean-style configuration, which makes it very easy to set up as Spring-managed bean. The implementation class becomes the bean class; the remaining properties are applied as bean properties (starting with lower-case characters, in contrast to the corresponding JDO properties). For example, in case of JPOX:  <bean id="persistenceManagerFactory" class="org.jpox.PersistenceManagerFactoryImpl" destroy-method="close">   <property name="connectionFactory" ref="dataSource"/>   <property name="nontransactionalRead" value="true"/> </bean> Note that such direct setup of a PersistenceManagerFactory implementation is the only way to pass an external connection factory (i.e. a JDBC DataSource) into a JDO PersistenceManagerFactory. With the standard properties-driven approach, you can only use an internal connection pool or a JNDI DataSource. The close() method is standardized in JDO; don't forget to specify it as "destroy-method" for any PersistenceManagerFactory instance. Note that this FactoryBean will automatically invoke close() for the PersistenceManagerFactory that it creates, without any special configuration.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/orm/jdo/LocalPersistenceManagerFactoryBean.html

TransactionAwarePersistenceManagerFactoryProxy	A										<section class="prog__container">Proxy for a target JDO PersistenceManagerFactory, returning the current thread-bound PersistenceManager (the Spring-managed transactional PersistenceManager or the single OpenPersistenceManagerInView PersistenceManager) on getPersistenceManager(), if any. Essentially, getPersistenceManager() calls get seamlessly forwarded to PersistenceManagerFactoryUtils.getPersistenceManager(javax.jdo.PersistenceManagerFactory, boolean). Furthermore, PersistenceManager.close calls get forwarded to PersistenceManagerFactoryUtils.releasePersistenceManager(javax.jdo.PersistenceManager, javax.jdo.PersistenceManagerFactory). The main advantage of this proxy is that it allows DAOs to work with a plain JDO PersistenceManagerFactory reference, while still participating in Spring's (or a J2EE server's) resource and transaction management. DAOs will only rely on the JDO API in such a scenario, without any Spring dependencies. Note that the behavior of this proxy matches the behavior that the JDO spec defines for a PersistenceManagerFactory as exposed by a JCA connector, when deployed in a J2EE server. Hence, DAOs could seamlessly switch between a JNDI PersistenceManagerFactory and this proxy for a local PersistenceManagerFactory, receiving the reference through Dependency Injection. This will work without any Spring API dependencies in the DAO code! Of course, you can still access the target PersistenceManagerFactory even when your DAOs go through this proxy, by defining a bean reference that points directly at your target PersistenceManagerFactory bean.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/orm/jdo/TransactionAwarePersistenceManagerFactoryProxy.html

This class makes such a Spring-style PersistenceManager proxy available for bean references. The main advantage of this proxy is that it allows DAOs to work with a plain JDO PersistenceManager reference in JDO 3.0 style (see PersistenceManagerFactory.getPersistenceManagerProxy()), while still participating in Spring's resource and transaction management. The behavior of this proxy matches the behavior that the JDO 3.0 spec defines for a PersistenceManager proxy. Hence, DAOs could seamlessly switch between StandardPersistenceManagerProxyBean and this Spring-style proxy, receiving the reference through Dependency Injection.

AbstractEntityManagerFactoryBean	A										<section class="prog__container">Abstract FactoryBean that creates a local JPA EntityManagerFactory instance within a Spring application context. Encapsulates the common functionality between the different JPA bootstrap contracts (standalone as well as container).

Supports several different variants of "extended" EntityManagers: in particular, an "application-managed extended EntityManager", as defined by EntityManagerFactory.createEntityManager(), as well as a "container-managed extended EntityManager", as defined by PersistenceContextType.EXTENDED. The original difference between "application-managed" and "container-managed" was the need for explicit joining of an externally managed transaction through the EntityManager.joinTransaction() method in the "application" case versus the automatic joining on each user-level EntityManager operation in the "container" case. As of JPA 2.1, both join modes are available with both kinds of EntityManagers, so the difference between "application-" and "container-managed" is now primarily in the join mode default and in the restricted lifecycle of a container-managed EntityManager (i.e. tied to the object that it is injected into).</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/orm/jpa/ExtendedEntityManagerCreator.html

Note that switching to a JNDI lookup or to a LocalEntityManagerFactoryBean definition is just a matter of configuration! As with LocalEntityManagerFactoryBean, configuration settings are usually read in from a META-INF/persistence.xml config file, residing in the class path, according to the general JPA configuration contract. However, this FactoryBean is more flexible in that you can override the location of the persistence.xml file, specify the JDBC DataSources to link to, etc. Furthermore, it allows for pluggable class instrumentation through Spring's LoadTimeWeaver abstraction, instead of being tied to a special VM agent specified on JVM startup. Internally, this FactoryBean parses the persistence.xml file itself and creates a corresponding PersistenceUnitInfo object (with further configuration merged in, such as JDBC DataSources and the Spring LoadTimeWeaver), to be passed to the chosen JPA PersistenceProvider. This corresponds to a local JPA container with full support for the standard JPA container contract. The exposed EntityManagerFactory object will implement all the interfaces of the underlying native EntityManagerFactory returned by the PersistenceProvider, plus the EntityManagerFactoryInfo interface which exposes additional metadata as assembled by this FactoryBean. NOTE: Spring's JPA support requires JPA 2.0 or higher, as of Spring 4.0. JPA 1.0 based applications are still supported; however, a JPA 2.0/2.1 compliant persistence provider is needed at runtime. Spring's persistence unit bootstrapping automatically detects JPA 2.0 vs 2.1 through checking the JPA API on the classpath.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/orm/jpa/LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean.html
LocalEntityManagerFactoryBean	A										<section class="prog__container">FactoryBean that creates a JPA EntityManagerFactory according to JPA's standard standalone bootstrap contract. This is the simplest way to set up a shared JPA EntityManagerFactory in a Spring application context; the EntityManagerFactory can then be passed to JPA-based DAOs via dependency injection. Note that switching to a JNDI lookup or to a LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean definition is just a matter of configuration! Configuration settings are usually read from a META-INF/persistence.xml config file, residing in the class path, according to the JPA standalone bootstrap contract. Additionally, most JPA providers will require a special VM agent (specified on JVM startup) that allows them to instrument application classes. See the Java Persistence API specification and your provider documentation for setup details. This EntityManagerFactory bootstrap is appropriate for standalone applications which solely use JPA for data access. If you want to set up your persistence provider for an external DataSource and/or for global transactions which span multiple resources, you will need to either deploy it into a full Java EE application server and access the deployed EntityManagerFactory via JNDI, or use Spring's LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean with appropriate configuration for local setup according to JPA's container contract. Note: This FactoryBean has limited configuration power in terms of what configuration it is able to pass to the JPA provider. If you need more flexible configuration, for example passing a Spring-managed JDBC DataSource to the JPA provider, consider using Spring's more powerful LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean instead. NOTE: Spring's JPA support requires JPA 2.0 or higher, as of Spring 4.0. JPA 1.0 based applications are still supported; however, a JPA 2.0/2.1 compliant persistence provider is needed at runtime.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/orm/jpa/LocalEntityManagerFactoryBean.html
SharedEntityManagerCreator	A										<section class="prog__container">Delegate for creating a shareable JPA EntityManager reference for a given EntityManagerFactory. A shared EntityManager will behave just like an EntityManager fetched from an application server's JNDI environment, as defined by the JPA specification. It will delegate all calls to the current transactional EntityManager, if any; otherwise it will fall back to a newly created EntityManager per operation. For a behavioral definition of such a shared transactional EntityManager, see PersistenceContextType.TRANSACTION and its discussion in the JPA spec document. This is also the default being used for the annotation-based PersistenceContext.type().</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/orm/jpa/SharedEntityManagerCreator.html
DefaultPersistenceUnitManager	A										<section class="prog__container">Default implementation of the PersistenceUnitManager interface. Used as internal default by LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean. Supports standard JPA scanning for persistence.xml files, with configurable file locations, JDBC DataSource lookup and load-time weaving. The default XML file location is classpath*:META-INF/persistence.xml, scanning for all matching files in the classpath (as defined in the JPA specification). DataSource names are by default interpreted as JNDI names, and no load time weaving is available (which requires weaving to be turned off in the persistence provider). NOTE: Spring's JPA support requires JPA 2.0 or higher, as of Spring 4.0. Spring's persistence unit bootstrapping automatically detects JPA 2.1 at runtime.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/orm/jpa/persistenceunit/DefaultPersistenceUnitManager.html
MutablePersistenceUnitInfo	A										<section class="prog__container">Spring's base implementation of the JPA PersistenceUnitInfo interface, used to bootstrap an EntityManagerFactory in a container. This implementation is largely a JavaBean, offering mutators for all standard PersistenceUnitInfo properties.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/orm/jpa/persistenceunit/MutablePersistenceUnitInfo.html
PersistenceUnitManager	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface that defines an abstraction for finding and managing JPA PersistenceUnitInfos. Used by LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean in order to obtain a PersistenceUnitInfo for building a concrete EntityManagerFactory. Obtaining a PersistenceUnitInfo instance is an exclusive process. A PersistenceUnitInfo instance is not available for further calls anymore once it has been obtained.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/orm/jpa/persistenceunit/PersistenceUnitManager.html
PersistenceUnitPostProcessor	A										<section class="prog__container">Callback interface for post-processing a JPA PersistenceUnitInfo. Implementations can be registered with a DefaultPersistenceUnitManager or via a LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/orm/jpa/persistenceunit/PersistenceUnitPostProcessor.html
SmartPersistenceUnitInfo	A										<section class="prog__container">Extension of the standard JPA PersistenceUnitInfo interface, for advanced collaboration between Spring's LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean and PersistenceUnitManager implementations.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/orm/jpa/persistenceunit/SmartPersistenceUnitInfo.html
OpenEntityManagerInViewFilter	A										<section class="prog__container">Servlet Filter that binds a JPA EntityManager to the thread for the entire processing of the request. Intended for the "Open EntityManager in View" pattern, i.e. to allow for lazy loading in web views despite the original transactions already being completed. This filter makes JPA EntityManagers available via the current thread, which will be autodetected by transaction managers. It is suitable for service layer transactions via JpaTransactionManager or JtaTransactionManager as well as for non-transactional read-only execution. Looks up the EntityManagerFactory in Spring's root web application context. Supports an "entityManagerFactoryBeanName" filter init-param in web.xml; the default bean name is "entityManagerFactory". As an alternative, the "persistenceUnitName" init-param allows for retrieval by logical unit name (as specified in persistence.xml).</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/orm/jpa/support/OpenEntityManagerInViewFilter.html
OpenEntityManagerInViewInterceptor	A										<section class="prog__container">Spring web request interceptor that binds a JPA EntityManager to the thread for the entire processing of the request. Intended for the "Open EntityManager in View" pattern, i.e. to allow for lazy loading in web views despite the original transactions already being completed. This interceptor makes JPA EntityManagers available via the current thread, which will be autodetected by transaction managers. It is suitable for service layer transactions via JpaTransactionManager or JtaTransactionManager as well as for non-transactional read-only execution. In contrast to OpenEntityManagerInViewFilter, this interceptor is set up in a Spring application context and can thus take advantage of bean wiring.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/orm/jpa/support/OpenEntityManagerInViewInterceptor.html
PersistenceAnnotationBeanPostProcessor	A										<section class="prog__container">BeanPostProcessor that processes PersistenceUnit and PersistenceContext annotations, for injection of the corresponding JPA resources EntityManagerFactory and EntityManager. Any such annotated fields or methods in any Spring-managed object will automatically be injected. This post-processor will inject sub-interfaces of EntityManagerFactory and EntityManager if the annotated fields or methods are declared as such. The actual type will be verified early, with the exception of a shared ("transactional") EntityManager reference, where type mismatches might be detected as late as on the first actual invocation. Note: In the present implementation, PersistenceAnnotationBeanPostProcessor only supports @PersistenceUnit and @PersistenceContext with the "unitName" attribute, or no attribute at all (for the default unit). If those annotations are present with the "name" attribute at the class level, they will simply be ignored, since those only serve as deployment hint (as per the Java EE specification). This post-processor can either obtain EntityManagerFactory beans defined in the Spring application context (the default), or obtain EntityManagerFactory references from JNDI ("persistence unit references"). In the bean case, the persistence unit name will be matched against the actual deployed unit, with the bean name used as fallback unit name if no deployed name found. Typically, Spring's LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean will be used for setting up such EntityManagerFactory beans. Alternatively, such beans may also be obtained from JNDI, e.g. using the jee:jndi-lookup XML configuration element (with the bean name matching the requested unit name). In both cases, the post-processor definition will look as simple as this:  <bean class="org.springframework.orm.jpa.support.PersistenceAnnotationBeanPostProcessor"/> In the JNDI case, specify the corresponding JNDI names in this post-processor's "persistenceUnits" map, typically with matching persistence-unit-ref entries in the Java EE deployment descriptor. By default, those names are considered as resource references (according to the Java EE resource-ref convention), located underneath the "java:comp/env/" namespace. For example:  <bean class="org.springframework.orm.jpa.support.PersistenceAnnotationBeanPostProcessor">   <property name="persistenceUnits">     <map/gt;       <entry key="unit1" value="persistence/unit1"/>       <entry key="unit2" value="persistence/unit2"/>     </map/gt;   </property> </bean> In this case, the specified persistence units will always be resolved in JNDI rather than as Spring-defined beans. The entire persistence unit deployment, including the weaving of persistent classes, is then up to the Java EE server. Persistence contexts (i.e. EntityManager references) will be built based on those server-provided EntityManagerFactory references, using Spring's own transaction synchronization facilities for transactional EntityManager handling (typically with Spring's @Transactional annotation for demarcation and JtaTransactionManager as backend). If you prefer the Java EE server's own EntityManager handling, specify entries in this post-processor's "persistenceContexts" map (or "extendedPersistenceContexts" map, typically with matching persistence-context-ref entries in the Java EE deployment descriptor. For example:  <bean class="org.springframework.orm.jpa.support.PersistenceAnnotationBeanPostProcessor">   <property name="persistenceContexts">     <map/gt;       <entry key="unit1" value="persistence/context1"/>       <entry key="unit2" value="persistence/context2"/>     </map/gt;   </property> </bean> If the application only obtains EntityManager references in the first place, this is all you need to specify. If you need EntityManagerFactory references as well, specify entries for both "persistenceUnits" and "persistenceContexts", pointing to matching JNDI locations. NOTE: In general, do not inject EXTENDED EntityManagers into STATELESS beans, i.e. do not use @PersistenceContext with type EXTENDED in Spring beans defined with scope 'singleton' (Spring's default scope). Extended EntityManagers are not thread-safe, hence they must not be used in concurrently accessed beans (which Spring-managed singletons usually are). Note: A default PersistenceAnnotationBeanPostProcessor will be registered by the "context:annotation-config" and "context:component-scan" XML tags. Remove or turn off the default annotation configuration there if you intend to specify a custom PersistenceAnnotationBeanPostProcessor bean definition.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/orm/jpa/support/PersistenceAnnotationBeanPostProcessor.html
SharedEntityManagerBean	A										<section class="prog__container">FactoryBean that exposes a shared JPA EntityManager reference for a given EntityManagerFactory. Typically used for an EntityManagerFactory created by LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean, as direct alternative to a JNDI lookup for a Java EE server's EntityManager reference. The shared EntityManager will behave just like an EntityManager fetched from an application server's JNDI environment, as defined by the JPA specification. It will delegate all calls to the current transactional EntityManager, if any; otherwise, it will fall back to a newly created EntityManager per operation. Can be passed to DAOs that expect a shared EntityManager reference rather than an EntityManagerFactory. Note that Spring's JpaTransactionManager always needs an EntityManagerFactory in order to create new transactional EntityManager instances.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/orm/jpa/support/SharedEntityManagerBean.html
AbstractJpaVendorAdapter	A										<section class="prog__container">Abstract JpaVendorAdapter implementation that defines common properties, to be translated into vendor-specific JPA properties by concrete subclasses.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/orm/jpa/vendor/AbstractJpaVendorAdapter.html
Database	A										<section class="prog__container">Enumeration for common database platforms. Allows strong typing of database type and portable configuration between JpaVendorDialect implementations. If a given PersistenceProvider supports a database not listed here, the strategy class can still be specified using the fully-qualified class name. This enumeration is merely a convenience. The database products listed here are the same as those explicitly supported for Spring JDBC exception translation in sql-error-codes.xml.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/orm/jpa/vendor/Database.html
EclipseLinkJpaDialect	A										<section class="prog__container">JpaDialect implementation for Eclipse Persistence Services (EclipseLink). Developed and tested against EclipseLink 2.4. By default, this class acquires an early EclipseLink transaction with an early JDBC Connection for non-read-only transactions. This allows for mixing JDBC and JPA/EclipseLink operations in the same transaction, with cross visibility of their impact. If this is not needed, set the "lazyDatabaseTransaction" flag to true or consistently declare all affected transactions as read-only. As of Spring 4.1.2, this will reliably avoid early JDBC Connection retrieval and therefore keep EclipseLink in shared cache mode.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/orm/jpa/vendor/EclipseLinkJpaDialect.html
EclipseLinkJpaVendorAdapter	A										<section class="prog__container">JpaVendorAdapter implementation for Eclipse Persistence Services (EclipseLink). Developed and tested against EclipseLink 2.4. Exposes EclipseLink's persistence provider and EntityManager extension interface, and adapts AbstractJpaVendorAdapter's common configuration settings. No support for the detection of annotated packages (through SmartPersistenceUnitInfo.getManagedPackages()) since EclipseLink doesn't use package-level metadata.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/orm/jpa/vendor/EclipseLinkJpaVendorAdapter.html

HibernateJpaVendorAdapter	A										<section class="prog__container">JpaVendorAdapter implementation for Hibernate EntityManager. Developed and tested against Hibernate 3.6, 4.2/4.3 as well as 5.x. Hibernate 4.2+ is strongly recommended for use with Spring 4.0+.Exposes Hibernate's persistence provider and EntityManager extension interface, and adapts AbstractJpaVendorAdapter's common configuration settings. Also supports the detection of annotated packages (through SmartPersistenceUnitInfo.getManagedPackages()), e.g. containing Hibernate FilterDef annotations, along with Spring-driven entity scanning which requires no persistence.xml (LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean.setPackagesToScan(java.lang.String...)). Note that the package location of Hibernate's JPA support changed from 4.2 to 4.3: from org.hibernate.ejb.HibernateEntityManager(Factory) to org.hibernate.jpa.HibernateEntityManager(Factory). As of Spring 4.0, we're exposing the correct, non-deprecated variant depending on the Hibernate version encountered at runtime, in order to avoid deprecation log entries.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/orm/jpa/vendor/HibernateJpaVendorAdapter.html
OpenJpaDialect	A										<section class="prog__container">JpaDialect implementation for Apache OpenJPA. Developed and tested against OpenJPA 2.2.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/orm/jpa/vendor/OpenJpaDialect.html

Marshaller	A										<section class="prog__container">Defines the contract for Object XML Mapping Marshallers. Implementations of this interface can serialize a given Object to an XML Stream. Although the marshal method accepts a java.lang.Object as its first parameter, most Marshaller implementations cannot handle arbitrary Objects.

By default, Castor does not require any further configuration, though setting target classes, target packages or providing a mapping file can be used to have more control over the behavior of Castor. If a target class is specified using setTargetClass, the CastorMarshaller can only be used to unmarshal XML that represents that specific class. If you want to unmarshal multiple classes, you have to provide a mapping file using setMappingLocations. Due to limitations of Castor's API, it is required to set the encoding used for writing to output streams.

Even though MarshallingSource extends from SAXSource, calling the methods of SAXSource is not supported. In general, the only supported operation on this class is to use the XMLReader obtained via SAXSource.getXMLReader() to parse the input source obtained via SAXSource.getInputSource(). Calling setXMLReader(XMLReader) or setInputSource(InputSource) will result in UnsupportedOperationExceptions.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/oxm/support/MarshallingSource.html

CatchAllConverter	A										<section class="prog__container">XStream Converter that supports all classes but throws exceptions for (un)marshalling. Main purpose of this class is to register this converter as a catch-all converter with a normal or higher priority, in addition to converters that explicitly support the domain classes that should be supported. As a result, default XStream converters with lower priorities and possible security vulnerabilities do not get invoked. For instance: XStreamMarshaller unmarshaller = new XStreamMarshaller(); unmarshaller.getXStream().registerConverter(new MyDomainClassConverter(), XStream.PRIORITY_VERY_HIGH); unmarshaller.getXStream().registerConverter(new CatchAllConverter(), XStream.PRIORITY_NORMAL); MyDomainClass o = unmarshaller.unmarshal(source); </section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/oxm/xstream/CatchAllConverter.html
XStreamMarshaller	A										<section class="prog__container">Implementation of the Marshaller interface for XStream. By default, XStream does not require any further configuration and can (un)marshal any class on the classpath. As such, it is not recommended to use the XStreamMarshaller to unmarshal XML from external sources (i.e. the Web), as this can result in security vulnerabilities. If you do use the XStreamMarshaller to unmarshal external XML, set the supportedClasses and converters properties (possibly using a CatchAllConverter) or override the customizeXStream(XStream) method to make sure it only accepts the classes you want it to support. Due to XStream's API, it is required to set the encoding used for writing to OutputStreams. It defaults to UTF-8. NOTE: XStream is an XML serialization library, not a data binding library. Therefore, it has limited namespace support. As such, it is rather unsuitable for usage within Web Services. This marshaller requires XStream 1.4.5 or higher, as of Spring 4.3. Note that XStream construction has been reworked in 4.0, with the stream driver and the class loader getting passed into XStream itself now.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/oxm/xstream/XStreamMarshaller.html
RemoteAccessException	A										<section class="prog__container">Generic remote access exception. A service proxy for any remoting protocol should throw this exception or subclasses of it, in order to transparently expose a plain Java business interface. When using conforming proxies, switching the actual remoting protocol e.g. from Hessian to Burlap does not affect client code. Clients work with a plain natural Java business interface that the service exposes. A client object simply receives an implementation for the interface that it needs via a bean reference, like it does for a local bean as well. A client may catch RemoteAccessException if it wants to, but as remote access errors are typically unrecoverable, it will probably let such exceptions propagate to a higher level that handles them generically. In this case, the client code doesn't show any signs of being involved in remote access, as there aren't any remoting-specific dependencies. Even when switching from a remote service proxy to a local implementation of the same interface, this amounts to just a matter of configuration. Obviously, the client code should be somewhat aware that it might be working against a remote service, for example in terms of repeated method calls that cause unnecessary roundtrips etc. However, it doesn't have to be aware whether it is actually working against a remote service or a local implementation, or with which remoting protocol it is working under the hood.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/remoting/RemoteAccessException.html

CodebaseAwareObjectInputStream	A										<section class="prog__container">Special ObjectInputStream subclass that falls back to a specified codebase to load classes from if not found locally. In contrast to standard RMI conventions for dynamic class download, it is the client that determines the codebase URL here, rather than the "java.rmi.server.codebase" system property on the server. Uses the JDK's RMIClassLoader to load classes from the specified codebase. The codebase can consist of multiple URLs, separated by spaces. Note that RMIClassLoader requires a SecurityManager to be set, like when using dynamic class download with standard RMI! (See the RMI documentation for details.) Despite residing in the RMI package, this class is not used for RmiClientInterceptor, which uses the standard RMI infrastructure instead and thus is only able to rely on RMI's standard dynamic class download via "java.rmi.server.codebase". CodebaseAwareObjectInputStream is used by HttpInvokerClientInterceptor (see the "codebaseUrl" property there). Thanks to Lionel Mestre for suggesting the option and providing a prototype!</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/remoting/rmi/CodebaseAwareObjectInputStream.html
JndiRmiClientInterceptor	A										<section class="prog__container">MethodInterceptor for accessing RMI services from JNDI. Typically used for RMI-IIOP (CORBA), but can also be used for EJB home objects (for example, a Stateful Session Bean home). In contrast to a plain JNDI lookup, this accessor also performs narrowing through PortableRemoteObject. With conventional RMI services, this invoker is typically used with the RMI service interface. Alternatively, this invoker can also proxy a remote RMI service with a matching non-RMI business interface, i.e. an interface that mirrors the RMI service methods but does not declare RemoteExceptions. In the latter case, RemoteExceptions thrown by the RMI stub will automatically get converted to Spring's unchecked RemoteAccessException. The JNDI environment can be specified as "jndiEnvironment" property, or be configured in a jndi.properties file or as system properties. For example: <property name="jndiEnvironment">         <props>                 <prop key="java.naming.factory.initial">com.sun.jndi.cosnaming.CNCtxFactory</prop>                 <prop key="java.naming.provider.url">iiop://localhost:1050</prop>         </props> </property></section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/remoting/rmi/JndiRmiClientInterceptor.html

JndiRmiServiceExporter	A										<section class="prog__container">Service exporter which binds RMI services to JNDI. Typically used for RMI-IIOP (CORBA). Exports services via the PortableRemoteObject class. You need to run "rmic" with the "-iiop" option to generate corresponding stubs and skeletons for each exported service. Also supports exposing any non-RMI service via RMI invokers, to be accessed via JndiRmiClientInterceptor / JndiRmiProxyFactoryBean's automatic detection of such invokers. With an RMI invoker, RMI communication works on the RmiInvocationHandler level, needing only one stub for any service. Service interfaces do not have to extend java.rmi.Remote or throw java.rmi.RemoteException on all methods, but in and out parameters have to be serializable. The JNDI environment can be specified as "jndiEnvironment" bean property, or be configured in a jndi.properties file or as system properties. For example: <property name="jndiEnvironment">         <props>                 <prop key="java.naming.factory.initial">com.sun.jndi.cosnaming.CNCtxFactory</prop>                 <prop key="java.naming.provider.url">iiop://localhost:1050</prop>         </props> </property></section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/remoting/rmi/JndiRmiServiceExporter.html

RmiBasedExporter	A										<section class="prog__container">Convenient superclass for RMI-based remote exporters. Provides a facility to automatically wrap a given plain Java service object with an RmiInvocationWrapper, exposing the RmiInvocationHandler remote interface. Using the RMI invoker mechanism, RMI communication operates at the RmiInvocationHandler level, sharing a common invoker stub for any number of services. Service interfaces are not required to extend java.rmi.Remote or declare java.rmi.RemoteException on all service methods. However, in and out parameters still have to be serializable.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/remoting/rmi/RmiBasedExporter.html
RmiClientInterceptor	A										<section class="prog__container">MethodInterceptor for accessing conventional RMI services or RMI invokers. The service URL must be a valid RMI URL (e.g. "rmi://localhost:1099/myservice"). RMI invokers work at the RmiInvocationHandler level, needing only one stub for any service. Service interfaces do not have to extend java.rmi.Remote or throw java.rmi.RemoteException. Spring's unchecked RemoteAccessException will be thrown on remote invocation failure. Of course, in and out parameters have to be serializable. With conventional RMI services, this invoker is typically used with the RMI service interface. Alternatively, this invoker can also proxy a remote RMI service with a matching non-RMI business interface, i.e. an interface that mirrors the RMI service methods but does not declare RemoteExceptions.

RmiInvocationHandler	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface for RMI invocation handlers instances on the server, wrapping exported services. A client uses a stub implementing this interface to access such a service. This is an SPI interface, not to be used directly by applications.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/remoting/rmi/RmiInvocationHandler.html
RmiProxyFactoryBean	A										<section class="prog__container">FactoryBean for RMI proxies, supporting both conventional RMI services and RMI invokers. Exposes the proxied service for use as a bean reference, using the specified service interface. Proxies will throw Spring's unchecked RemoteAccessException on remote invocation failure instead of RMI's RemoteException. The service URL must be a valid RMI URL like "rmi://localhost:1099/myservice". RMI invokers work at the RmiInvocationHandler level, using the same invoker stub for any service. Service interfaces do not have to extend java.rmi.Remote or throw java.rmi.RemoteException. Of course, in and out parameters have to be serializable. With conventional RMI services, this proxy factory is typically used with the RMI service interface. Alternatively, this factory can also proxy a remote RMI service with a matching non-RMI business interface, i.e. an interface that mirrors the RMI service methods but does not declare RemoteExceptions. In the latter case, RemoteExceptions thrown by the RMI stub will automatically get converted to Spring's unchecked RemoteAccessException. The major advantage of RMI, compared to Hessian and Burlap, is serialization. Effectively, any serializable Java object can be transported without hassle. Hessian and Burlap have their own (de-)serialization mechanisms, but are HTTP-based and thus much easier to setup than RMI. Alternatively, consider Spring's HTTP invoker to combine Java serialization with HTTP-based transport.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/remoting/rmi/RmiProxyFactoryBean.html
RmiRegistryFactoryBean	A										<section class="prog__container">FactoryBean that locates a Registry and exposes it for bean references. Can also create a local RMI registry on the fly if none exists already. Can be used to set up and pass around the actual Registry object to applications objects that need to work with RMI. One example for such an object that needs to work with RMI is Spring's RmiServiceExporter, which either works with a passed-in Registry reference or falls back to the registry as specified by its local properties and defaults. Also useful to enforce creation of a local RMI registry at a given port, for example for a JMX connector. If used in conjunction with ConnectorServerFactoryBean, it is recommended to mark the connector definition (ConnectorServerFactoryBean) as "depends-on" the registry definition (RmiRegistryFactoryBean), to guarantee starting up the registry first. Note: The implementation of this class mirrors the corresponding logic in RmiServiceExporter, and also offers the same customization hooks. RmiServiceExporter implements its own registry lookup as a convenience: It is very common to simply rely on the registry defaults.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/remoting/rmi/RmiRegistryFactoryBean.html
RmiServiceExporter	A										<section class="prog__container">RMI exporter that exposes the specified service as RMI object with the specified name. Such services can be accessed via plain RMI or via RmiProxyFactoryBean. Also supports exposing any non-RMI service via RMI invokers, to be accessed via RmiClientInterceptor / RmiProxyFactoryBean's automatic detection of such invokers. With an RMI invoker, RMI communication works on the RmiInvocationHandler level, needing only one stub for any service. Service interfaces do not have to extend java.rmi.Remote or throw java.rmi.RemoteException on all methods, but in and out parameters have to be serializable. The major advantage of RMI, compared to Hessian and Burlap, is serialization. Effectively, any serializable Java object can be transported without hassle. Hessian and Burlap have their own (de-)serialization mechanisms, but are HTTP-based and thus much easier to setup than RMI. Alternatively, consider Spring's HTTP invoker to combine Java serialization with HTTP-based transport. Note: RMI makes a best-effort attempt to obtain the fully qualified host name. If one cannot be determined, it will fall back and use the IP address. Depending on your network configuration, in some cases it will resolve the IP to the loopback address. To ensure that RMI will use the host name bound to the correct network interface, you should pass the java.rmi.server.hostname property to the JVM that will export the registry and/or the service using the "-D" JVM argument. For example: -Djava.rmi.server.hostname=myserver.com</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/remoting/rmi/RmiServiceExporter.html

If the processing of a remote call results in a checked exception, the exception will get logged at INFO level; if it results in an unchecked exception (or error), the exception will get logged at WARN level. The logging of exceptions is particularly useful to save the stacktrace information on the server-side rather than just propagating the exception to the client (who might or might not log it properly).</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/remoting/support/RemoteInvocationTraceInterceptor.html
RemoteInvocationUtils	A										<section class="prog__container">General utilities for handling remote invocations. Mainly intended for use within the remoting framework.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/remoting/support/RemoteInvocationUtils.html

SimpleHttpServerFactoryBean	A										<section class="prog__container">FactoryBean that creates a simple HTTP server, based on the HTTP server that is included in Sun's JRE 1.6. Starts the HTTP server on initialization and stops it on destruction. Exposes the resulting HttpServer object. Allows for registering HttpHandlers for specific context paths. Alternatively, register such context-specific handlers programmatically on the HttpServer itself.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/remoting/support/SimpleHttpServerFactoryBean.html
UrlBasedRemoteAccessor	A										<section class="prog__container">Abstract base class for classes that access remote services via URLs. Provides a "serviceUrl" bean property, which is considered as required.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/remoting/support/UrlBasedRemoteAccessor.html
SchedulingAwareRunnable	A										<section class="prog__container">Extension of the Runnable interface, adding special callbacks for long-running operations. This interface closely corresponds to the CommonJ Work interface, but is kept separate to avoid a required CommonJ dependency. Scheduling-capable TaskExecutors are encouraged to check a submitted Runnable, detecting whether this interface is implemented and reacting as appropriately as they are able to.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/SchedulingAwareRunnable.html
SchedulingException	A										<section class="prog__container">General exception to be thrown on scheduling failures, such as the scheduler already having shut down. Unchecked since scheduling failures are usually fatal.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/SchedulingException.html
SchedulingTaskExecutor	A										<section class="prog__container">A TaskExecutor extension exposing scheduling characteristics that are relevant to potential task submitters. Scheduling clients are encouraged to submit Runnables that match the exposed preferences of the TaskExecutor implementation in use. Note: SchedulingTaskExecutor implementations are encouraged to also implement the AsyncListenableTaskExecutor interface. This is not required due to the dependency on Spring 4.0's new ListenableFuture interface, which would make it impossible for third-party executor implementations to remain compatible with both Spring 4.0 and Spring 3.x.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/SchedulingTaskExecutor.html
TaskScheduler	A										<section class="prog__container">Task scheduler interface that abstracts the scheduling of Runnables based on different kinds of triggers. This interface is separate from SchedulingTaskExecutor since it usually represents for a different kind of backend, i.e. a thread pool with different characteristics and capabilities. Implementations may implement both interfaces if they can handle both kinds of execution characteristics. The 'default' implementation is ThreadPoolTaskScheduler, wrapping a native ScheduledExecutorService and adding extended trigger capabilities. This interface is roughly equivalent to a JSR-236 ManagedScheduledExecutorService as supported in Java EE 6 environments. However, at the time of the Spring 3.0 release, the JSR-236 interfaces have not been released in official form yet.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/TaskScheduler.html

AnnotationAsyncExecutionInterceptor	A										<section class="prog__container">Specialization of AsyncExecutionInterceptor that delegates method execution to an Executor based on the Async annotation. Specifically designed to support use of Async.value() executor qualification mechanism introduced in Spring 3.1.2. Supports detecting qualifier metadata via @Async at the method or declaring class level. See getExecutorQualifier(Method) for details.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/annotation/AnnotationAsyncExecutionInterceptor.html
Async	A										<section class="prog__container">Annotation that marks a method as a candidate for asynchronous execution. Can also be used at the type level, in which case all of the type's methods are considered as asynchronous. In terms of target method signatures, any parameter types are supported. However, the return type is constrained to either void or Future. In the latter case, you may declare the more specific ListenableFuture or CompletableFuture types which allow for richer interaction with the asynchronous task and for immediate composition with further processing steps. A Future handle returned from the proxy will be an actual asynchronous Future that can be used to track the result of the asynchronous method execution. However, since the target method needs to implement the same signature, it will have to return a temporary Future handle that just passes a value through: e.g. Spring's AsyncResult, EJB 3.1's AsyncResult, or CompletableFuture.completedFuture(Object).</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/annotation/Async.html
AsyncAnnotationAdvisor	A										<section class="prog__container">Advisor that activates asynchronous method execution through the Async annotation. This annotation can be used at the method and type level in implementation classes as well as in service interfaces. This advisor detects the EJB 3.1 javax.ejb.Asynchronous annotation as well, treating it exactly like Spring's own Async. Furthermore, a custom async annotation type may get specified through the "asyncAnnotationType" property.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/annotation/AsyncAnnotationAdvisor.html
AsyncAnnotationBeanPostProcessor	A										<section class="prog__container">Bean post-processor that automatically applies asynchronous invocation behavior to any bean that carries the Async annotation at class or method-level by adding a corresponding AsyncAnnotationAdvisor to the exposed proxy (either an existing AOP proxy or a newly generated proxy that implements all of the target's interfaces). The TaskExecutor responsible for the asynchronous execution may be provided as well as the annotation type that indicates a method should be invoked asynchronously. If no annotation type is specified, this post- processor will detect both Spring's @Async annotation as well as the EJB 3.1 javax.ejb.Asynchronous annotation. For methods having a void return type, any exception thrown during the asynchronous method invocation cannot be accessed by the caller. An AsyncUncaughtExceptionHandler can be specified to handle these cases. Note: The underlying async advisor applies before existing advisors by default, in order to switch to async execution as early as possible in the invocation chain.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/annotation/AsyncAnnotationBeanPostProcessor.html
AsyncConfigurationSelector	A										<section class="prog__container">Selects which implementation of AbstractAsyncConfiguration should be used based on the value of EnableAsync.mode() on the importing @Configuration class.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/annotation/AsyncConfigurationSelector.html
AsyncConfigurer	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface to be implemented by @Configuration classes annotated with @EnableAsync that wish to customize the Executor instance used when processing async method invocations or the AsyncUncaughtExceptionHandler instance used to process exception thrown from async method with void return type. Consider using AsyncConfigurerSupport providing default implementations for both methods if only one element needs to be customized. Furthermore, backward compatibility of this interface will be insured in case new customization options are introduced in the future. See @EnableAsync for usage examples.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/annotation/AsyncConfigurer.html

Provides a backward compatible alternative of implementing AsyncConfigurer directly.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/annotation/AsyncConfigurerSupport.html
AsyncResult	A										<section class="prog__container">A pass-through Future handle that can be used for method signatures which are declared with a Future return type for asynchronous execution. As of Spring 4.1, this class implements ListenableFuture, not just plain Future, along with the corresponding support in @Async processing. As of Spring 4.2, this class also supports passing execution exceptions back to the caller.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/annotation/AsyncResult.html
EnableAsync	A										<section class="prog__container">Enables Spring's asynchronous method execution capability, similar to functionality found in Spring's <task:*> XML namespace. To be used together with @Configuration classes as follows, enabling annotation-driven async processing for an entire Spring application context:  @Configuration @EnableAsync public class AppConfig { }MyAsyncBean is a user-defined type with one or more methods annotated with either Spring's @Async annotation, the EJB 3.1 @javax.ejb.Asynchronous annotation, or any custom annotation specified via the annotation() attribute. The aspect is added transparently for any registered bean, for instance via this configuration:  @Configuration public class AnotherAppConfig {     @Bean     public MyAsyncBean asyncBean() {         return new MyAsyncBean();     } }The mode() attribute controls how advice is applied; if the mode is AdviceMode.PROXY (the default), then the other attributes control the behavior of the proxying. Note that if the mode() is set to AdviceMode.ASPECTJ, then the value of the proxyTargetClass() attribute will be ignored. Note also that in this case the spring-aspects module JAR must be present on the classpath. By default, Spring will be searching for an associated thread pool definition: either a unique TaskExecutor bean in the context, or an Executor bean named "taskExecutor" otherwise. If neither of the two is resolvable, a SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor will be used to process async method invocations. Besides, annotated methods having a void return type cannot transmit any exception back to the caller. By default, such uncaught exceptions are only logged. To customize all this, implement AsyncConfigurer and provide: your own Executor through the getAsyncExecutor() method, andyour own AsyncUncaughtExceptionHandler through the getAsyncUncaughtExceptionHandler() method. @Configuration @EnableAsync public class AppConfig implements AsyncConfigurer {     @Override     public Executor getAsyncExecutor() {         ThreadPoolTaskExecutor executor = new ThreadPoolTaskExecutor();         executor.setCorePoolSize(7);         executor.setMaxPoolSize(42);         executor.setQueueCapacity(11);         executor.setThreadNamePrefix("MyExecutor-");         executor.initialize();         return executor;     }     @Override     public AsyncUncaughtExceptionHandler getAsyncUncaughtExceptionHandler() {         return MyAsyncUncaughtExceptionHandler();     } }If only one item needs to be customized, null can be returned to keep the default settings. Consider also extending from AsyncConfigurerSupport when possible. Note: In the above example the ThreadPoolTaskExecutor is not a fully managed Spring bean. Add the @Bean annotation to the getAsyncExecutor() method if you want a fully managed bean. In such circumstances it is no longer necessary to manually call the executor.initialize() method as this will be invoked automatically when the bean is initialized. For reference, the example above can be compared to the following Spring XML configuration:  <beans>     <task:annotation-driven executor="myExecutor" exception-handler="exceptionHandler"/>     <task:executor id="myExecutor" pool-size="7-42" queue-capacity="11"/>     <bean id="asyncBean" class="com.foo.MyAsyncBean"/>     <bean id="exceptionHandler" class="com.foo.MyAsyncUncaughtExceptionHandler"/> </beans>  The above XML-based and JavaConfig-based examples are equivalent except for the setting of the thread name prefix of the Executor; this is because the <task:executor> element does not expose such an attribute. This demonstrates how the JavaConfig-based approach allows for maximum configurability through direct access to actual componentry.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/annotation/EnableAsync.html
EnableScheduling	A										<section class="prog__container">Enables Spring's scheduled task execution capability, similar to functionality found in Spring's <task:*> XML namespace. To be used on @Configuration classes as follows:  @Configuration @EnableScheduling public class AppConfig {     // various @Bean definitions } This enables detection of @Scheduled annotations on any Spring-managed bean in the container. For example, given a class MyTask package com.myco.tasks; public class MyTask {     @Scheduled(fixedRate=1000)     public void work() {         // task execution logic     } } the following configuration would ensure that MyTask.work() is called once every 1000 ms:  @Configuration @EnableScheduling public class AppConfig {     @Bean     public MyTask task() {         return new MyTask();     } } Alternatively, if MyTask were annotated with @Component, the following configuration would ensure that its @Scheduled method is invoked at the desired interval:  @Configuration @EnableScheduling @ComponentScan(basePackages="com.myco.tasks") public class AppConfig { } Methods annotated with @Scheduled may even be declared directly within @Configuration classes:  @Configuration @EnableScheduling public class AppConfig {     @Scheduled(fixedRate=1000)     public void work() {         // task execution logic     } }By default, will be searching for an associated scheduler definition: either a unique TaskScheduler bean in the context, or a TaskScheduler bean named "taskScheduler" otherwise; the same lookup will also be performed for a ScheduledExecutorService bean. If neither of the two is resolvable, a local single-threaded default scheduler will be created and used within the registrar. When more control is desired, a @Configuration class may implement SchedulingConfigurer. This allows access to the underlying ScheduledTaskRegistrar instance. For example, the following example demonstrates how to customize the Executor used to execute scheduled tasks:  @Configuration @EnableScheduling public class AppConfig implements SchedulingConfigurer {     @Override     public void configureTasks(ScheduledTaskRegistrar taskRegistrar) {         taskRegistrar.setScheduler(taskExecutor());     }     @Bean(destroyMethod="shutdown")     public Executor taskExecutor() {         return Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(100);     } }Note in the example above the use of @Bean(destroyMethod="shutdown"). This ensures that the task executor is properly shut down when the Spring application context itself is closed. Implementing SchedulingConfigurer also allows for fine-grained control over task registration via the ScheduledTaskRegistrar. For example, the following configures the execution of a particular bean method per a custom Trigger implementation:  @Configuration @EnableScheduling public class AppConfig implements SchedulingConfigurer {     @Override     public void configureTasks(ScheduledTaskRegistrar taskRegistrar) {         taskRegistrar.setScheduler(taskScheduler());         taskRegistrar.addTriggerTask(             new Runnable() {                 public void run() {                     myTask().work();                 }             },             new CustomTrigger()         );     }     @Bean(destroyMethod="shutdown")     public Executor taskScheduler() {         return Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(42);     }     @Bean     public MyTask myTask() {         return new MyTask();     } }For reference, the example above can be compared to the following Spring XML configuration:  <beans>     <task:annotation-driven scheduler="taskScheduler"/>     <task:scheduler id="taskScheduler" pool-size="42"/>     <task:scheduled-tasks scheduler="taskScheduler">         <task:scheduled ref="myTask" method="work" fixed-rate="1000"/>     </task:scheduled-tasks>     <bean id="myTask" class="com.foo.MyTask"/> </beans>  The examples are equivalent save that in XML a fixed-rate period is used instead of a custom Trigger implementation; this is because the task: namespace scheduled cannot easily expose such support. This is but one demonstration how the code-based approach allows for maximum configurability through direct access to actual componentry.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/annotation/EnableScheduling.html

Scheduled	A										<section class="prog__container">An annotation that marks a method to be scheduled. Exactly one of the cron(), fixedDelay(), or fixedRate() attributes must be specified. The annotated method must expect no arguments. It will typically have a void return type; if not, the returned value will be ignored when called through the scheduler. Processing of @Scheduled annotations is performed by registering a ScheduledAnnotationBeanPostProcessor. This can be done manually or, more conveniently, through the <task:annotation-driven/> element or @EnableScheduling annotation. This annotation may be used as a meta-annotation to create custom composed annotations with attribute overrides.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/annotation/Scheduled.html
ScheduledAnnotationBeanPostProcessor	A										<section class="prog__container">Bean post-processor that registers methods annotated with @Scheduled to be invoked by a TaskScheduler according to the "fixedRate", "fixedDelay", or "cron" expression provided via the annotation. This post-processor is automatically registered by Spring's <task:annotation-driven> XML element, and also by the @EnableScheduling annotation. Autodetects any SchedulingConfigurer instances in the container, allowing for customization of the scheduler to be used or for fine-grained control over task registration (e.g. registration of Trigger tasks. See the @EnableScheduling javadocs for complete usage details.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/annotation/ScheduledAnnotationBeanPostProcessor.html
Schedules	A										<section class="prog__container">Container annotation that aggregates several Scheduled annotations. Can be used natively, declaring several nested Scheduled annotations. Can also be used in conjunction with Java 8's support for repeatable annotations, where Scheduled can simply be declared several times on the same method, implicitly generating this container annotation. This annotation may be used as a meta-annotation to create custom composed annotations.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/annotation/Schedules.html
SchedulingConfiguration	A										<section class="prog__container">@Configuration class that registers a ScheduledAnnotationBeanPostProcessor bean capable of processing Spring's @Scheduled annotation. This configuration class is automatically imported when using the @EnableScheduling annotation.

SchedulingConfigurer	A										<section class="prog__container">Optional interface to be implemented by @Configuration classes annotated with @EnableScheduling. Typically used for setting a specific TaskScheduler bean to be used when executing scheduled tasks or for registering scheduled tasks in a programmatic fashion as opposed to the declarative approach of using the @Scheduled annotation. For example, this may be necessary when implementing Trigger-based tasks, which are not supported by the @Scheduled annotation. See @EnableScheduling for detailed usage examples.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/annotation/SchedulingConfigurer.html

ScheduledTimerListener	A										<section class="prog__container">JavaBean that describes a scheduled TimerListener, consisting of the TimerListener itself (or a Runnable to create a TimerListener for) and a delay plus period. Period needs to be specified; there is no point in a default for it. The CommonJ TimerManager does not offer more sophisticated scheduling options such as cron expressions. Consider using Quartz for such advanced needs. Note that the TimerManager uses a TimerListener instance that is shared between repeated executions, in contrast to Quartz which instantiates a new Job for each execution.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/commonj/ScheduledTimerListener.html

TimerManagerFactoryBean	A										<section class="prog__container">FactoryBean that retrieves a CommonJ TimerManager and exposes it for bean references. This is the central convenience class for setting up a CommonJ TimerManager in a Spring context.Allows for registration of ScheduledTimerListeners. This is the main purpose of this class; the TimerManager itself could also be fetched from JNDI via JndiObjectFactoryBean. In scenarios that just require static registration of tasks at startup, there is no need to access the TimerManager itself in application code. Note that the TimerManager uses a TimerListener instance that is shared between repeated executions, in contrast to Quartz which instantiates a new Job for each execution.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/commonj/TimerManagerFactoryBean.html

WorkManagerTaskExecutor	A										<section class="prog__container">TaskExecutor implementation that delegates to a CommonJ WorkManager, implementing the WorkManager interface, which either needs to be specified as reference or through the JNDI name. This is the central convenience class for setting up a CommonJ WorkManager in a Spring context.Also implements the CommonJ WorkManager interface itself, delegating all calls to the target WorkManager. Hence, a caller can choose whether it wants to talk to this executor through the Spring TaskExecutor interface or the CommonJ WorkManager interface. The CommonJ WorkManager will usually be retrieved from the application server's JNDI environment, as defined in the server's management console. Note: On the upcoming EE 7 compliant versions of WebLogic and WebSphere, a DefaultManagedTaskExecutor should be preferred, following JSR-236 support in Java EE 7.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/commonj/WorkManagerTaskExecutor.html
ConcurrentTaskExecutor	A										<section class="prog__container">Adapter that takes a java.util.concurrent.Executor and exposes a Spring TaskExecutor for it. Also detects an extended java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService, adapting the AsyncTaskExecutor interface accordingly. Autodetects a JSR-236 ManagedExecutorService in order to expose ManagedTask adapters for it, exposing a long-running hint based on SchedulingAwareRunnable and an identity name based on the given Runnable/Callable's toString(). For JSR-236 style lookup in a Java EE 7 environment, consider using DefaultManagedTaskExecutor. Note that there is a pre-built ThreadPoolTaskExecutor that allows for defining a ThreadPoolExecutor in bean style, exposing it as a Spring TaskExecutor directly. This is a convenient alternative to a raw ThreadPoolExecutor definition with a separate definition of the present adapter class.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/concurrent/ConcurrentTaskExecutor.html
ConcurrentTaskExecutor.ManagedTaskBuilder	A										<section class="prog__container">Delegate that wraps a given Runnable/Callable  with a JSR-236 ManagedTask, exposing a long-running hint based on SchedulingAwareRunnable and a given identity name.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/concurrent/ConcurrentTaskExecutor.ManagedTaskBuilder.html
ConcurrentTaskScheduler	A										<section class="prog__container">Adapter that takes a java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService and exposes a Spring TaskScheduler for it. Extends ConcurrentTaskExecutor in order to implement the SchedulingTaskExecutor interface as well. Autodetects a JSR-236 ManagedScheduledExecutorService in order to use it for trigger-based scheduling if possible, instead of Spring's local trigger management which ends up delegating to regular delay-based scheduling against the java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService API. For JSR-236 style lookup in a Java EE 7 environment, consider using DefaultManagedTaskScheduler. Note that there is a pre-built ThreadPoolTaskScheduler that allows for defining a ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor in bean style, exposing it as a Spring TaskScheduler directly. This is a convenient alternative to a raw ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor definition with a separate definition of the present adapter class.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/concurrent/ConcurrentTaskScheduler.html
CustomizableThreadFactory	A										<section class="prog__container">Implementation of the ThreadFactory interface, allowing for customizing the created threads (name, priority, etc). See the base class CustomizableThreadCreator for details on the available configuration options.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/concurrent/CustomizableThreadFactory.html
DefaultManagedAwareThreadFactory	A										<section class="prog__container">JNDI-based variant of CustomizableThreadFactory, performing a default lookup for JSR-236's "java:comp/DefaultManagedThreadFactory" in a Java EE 7 environment, falling back to the local CustomizableThreadFactory setup if not found. This is a convenient way to use managed threads when running in a Java EE 7 environment, simply using regular local threads otherwise - without conditional setup (i.e. without profiles). Note: This class is not strictly JSR-236 based; it can work with any regular ThreadFactory that can be found in JNDI. Therefore, the default JNDI name "java:comp/DefaultManagedThreadFactory" can be customized through the "jndiName" bean property.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/concurrent/DefaultManagedAwareThreadFactory.html
DefaultManagedTaskExecutor	A										<section class="prog__container">JNDI-based variant of ConcurrentTaskExecutor, performing a default lookup for JSR-236's "java:comp/DefaultManagedExecutorService" in a Java EE 7 environment. Note: This class is not strictly JSR-236 based; it can work with any regular Executor that can be found in JNDI. The actual adapting to ManagedExecutorService happens in the base class ConcurrentTaskExecutor itself.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/concurrent/DefaultManagedTaskExecutor.html
DefaultManagedTaskScheduler	A										<section class="prog__container">JNDI-based variant of ConcurrentTaskScheduler, performing a default lookup for JSR-236's "java:comp/DefaultManagedScheduledExecutorService" in a Java EE 7 environment. Note: This class is not strictly JSR-236 based; it can work with any regular ScheduledExecutorService that can be found in JNDI.

ForkJoinPoolFactoryBean	A										<section class="prog__container">A Spring FactoryBean that builds and exposes a preconfigured ForkJoinPool. May be used on Java 7 and 8 as well as on Java 6 with jsr166.jar on the classpath (ideally on the VM bootstrap classpath). For details on the ForkJoinPool API and its use with RecursiveActions, see the JDK 7 javadoc. jsr166.jar, containing java.util.concurrent updates for Java 6, can be obtained from the concurrency interest website.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/concurrent/ForkJoinPoolFactoryBean.html
ScheduledExecutorFactoryBean	A										<section class="prog__container">FactoryBean that sets up a ScheduledExecutorService (by default: a ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor) and exposes it for bean references. Allows for registration of ScheduledExecutorTasks, automatically starting the ScheduledExecutorService on initialization and cancelling it on destruction of the context. In scenarios that only require static registration of tasks at startup, there is no need to access the ScheduledExecutorService instance itself in application code at all; ScheduledExecutorFactoryBean is then just being used for lifecycle integration. For an alternative, you may set up a ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor instance directly using constructor injection, or use a factory method definition that points to the Executors class. This is strongly recommended in particular for common @Bean methods in configuration classes, where this FactoryBean variant would force you to return the FactoryBean type instead of ScheduledExecutorService.Note that ScheduledExecutorService uses a Runnable instance that is shared between repeated executions, in contrast to Quartz which instantiates a new Job for each execution. WARNING: Runnables submitted via a native ScheduledExecutorService are removed from the execution schedule once they throw an exception. If you would prefer to continue execution after such an exception, switch this FactoryBean's "continueScheduledExecutionAfterException" property to "true".</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/concurrent/ScheduledExecutorFactoryBean.html
ScheduledExecutorTask	A										<section class="prog__container">JavaBean that describes a scheduled executor task, consisting of the Runnable and a delay plus period. The period needs to be specified; there is no point in a default for it. The ScheduledExecutorService does not offer more sophisticated scheduling options such as cron expressions. Consider using ThreadPoolTaskScheduler for such needs. Note that the ScheduledExecutorService mechanism uses a Runnable instance that is shared between repeated executions, in contrast to Quartz which creates a new Job instance for each execution.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/concurrent/ScheduledExecutorTask.html
ThreadPoolExecutorFactoryBean	A										<section class="prog__container">JavaBean that allows for configuring a ThreadPoolExecutor in bean style (through its "corePoolSize", "maxPoolSize", "keepAliveSeconds", "queueCapacity" properties) and exposing it as a bean reference of its native ExecutorService type. For an alternative, you may set up a ThreadPoolExecutor instance directly using constructor injection, or use a factory method definition that points to the Executors class. This is strongly recommended in particular for common @Bean methods in configuration classes, where this FactoryBean variant would force you to return the FactoryBean type instead of the actual Executor type.If you need a timing-based ScheduledExecutorService instead, consider ScheduledExecutorFactoryBean.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/concurrent/ThreadPoolExecutorFactoryBean.html
ThreadPoolTaskExecutor	A										<section class="prog__container">JavaBean that allows for configuring a ThreadPoolExecutor in bean style (through its "corePoolSize", "maxPoolSize", "keepAliveSeconds", "queueCapacity" properties) and exposing it as a Spring TaskExecutor. This class is also well suited for management and monitoring (e.g. through JMX), providing several useful attributes: "corePoolSize", "maxPoolSize", "keepAliveSeconds" (all supporting updates at runtime); "poolSize", "activeCount" (for introspection only). For an alternative, you may set up a ThreadPoolExecutor instance directly using constructor injection, or use a factory method definition that points to the Executors class. To expose such a raw Executor as a Spring TaskExecutor, simply wrap it with a ConcurrentTaskExecutor adapter. NOTE: This class implements Spring's TaskExecutor interface as well as the Executor interface, with the former being the primary interface, the other just serving as secondary convenience. For this reason, the exception handling follows the TaskExecutor contract rather than the Executor contract, in particular regarding the TaskRejectedException. If you prefer native ExecutorService exposure instead, consider ThreadPoolExecutorFactoryBean as an alternative to this class.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/concurrent/ThreadPoolTaskExecutor.html

CronTriggerFactoryBean	A										<section class="prog__container">A Spring FactoryBean for creating a Quartz CronTrigger instance, supporting bean-style usage for trigger configuration. CronTrigger(Impl) itself is already a JavaBean but lacks sensible defaults. This class uses the Spring bean name as job name, the Quartz default group ("DEFAULT") as job group, the current time as start time, and indefinite repetition, if not specified. This class will also register the trigger with the job name and group of a given JobDetail. This allows SchedulerFactoryBean to automatically register a trigger for the corresponding JobDetail, instead of registering the JobDetail separately.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/quartz/CronTriggerFactoryBean.html
DelegatingJob	A										<section class="prog__container">Simple Quartz Job adapter that delegates to a given Runnable instance.

LocalDataSourceJobStore	A										<section class="prog__container">Subclass of Quartz's JobStoreCMT class that delegates to a Spring-managed DataSource instead of using a Quartz-managed connection pool. This JobStore will be used if SchedulerFactoryBean's "dataSource" property is set. Supports both transactional and non-transactional DataSource access. With a non-XA DataSource and local Spring transactions, a single DataSource argument is sufficient. In case of an XA DataSource and global JTA transactions, SchedulerFactoryBean's "nonTransactionalDataSource" property should be set, passing in a non-XA DataSource that will not participate in global transactions. Operations performed by this JobStore will properly participate in any kind of Spring-managed transaction, as it uses Spring's DataSourceUtils connection handling methods that are aware of a current transaction. Note that all Quartz Scheduler operations that affect the persistent job store should usually be performed within active transactions, as they assume to get proper locks etc.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/quartz/LocalDataSourceJobStore.html
LocalTaskExecutorThreadPool	A										<section class="prog__container">Quartz ThreadPool adapter that delegates to a Spring-managed TaskExecutor instance, specified on SchedulerFactoryBean.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/quartz/LocalTaskExecutorThreadPool.html
MethodInvokingJobDetailFactoryBean	A										<section class="prog__container">FactoryBean that exposes a JobDetail object which delegates job execution to a specified (static or non-static) method. Avoids the need for implementing a one-line Quartz Job that just invokes an existing service method on a Spring-managed target bean. Inherits common configuration properties from the MethodInvoker base class, such as "targetObject" and "targetMethod", adding support for lookup of the target bean by name through the "targetBeanName" property (as alternative to specifying a "targetObject" directly, allowing for non-singleton target objects). Supports both concurrently running jobs and non-currently running jobs through the "concurrent" property. Jobs created by this MethodInvokingJobDetailFactoryBean are by default volatile and durable (according to Quartz terminology). NOTE: JobDetails created via this FactoryBean are not serializable and thus not suitable for persistent job stores. You need to implement your own Quartz Job as a thin wrapper for each case where you want a persistent job to delegate to a specific service method. Compatible with Quartz 2.1.4 and higher, as of Spring 4.1.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/quartz/MethodInvokingJobDetailFactoryBean.html
MethodInvokingJobDetailFactoryBean.MethodInvokingJob	A										<section class="prog__container">Quartz Job implementation that invokes a specified method. Automatically applied by MethodInvokingJobDetailFactoryBean.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/quartz/MethodInvokingJobDetailFactoryBean.MethodInvokingJob.html
MethodInvokingJobDetailFactoryBean.StatefulMethodInvokingJob	A										<section class="prog__container">Extension of the MethodInvokingJob, implementing the StatefulJob interface. Quartz checks whether or not jobs are stateful and if so, won't let jobs interfere with each other.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/quartz/MethodInvokingJobDetailFactoryBean.StatefulMethodInvokingJob.html
QuartzJobBean	A										<section class="prog__container">Simple implementation of the Quartz Job interface, applying the passed-in JobDataMap and also the SchedulerContext as bean property values. This is appropriate because a new Job instance will be created for each execution. JobDataMap entries will override SchedulerContext entries with the same keys. For example, let's assume that the JobDataMap contains a key "myParam" with value "5": The Job implementation can then expose a bean property "myParam" of type int to receive such a value, i.e. a method "setMyParam(int)". This will also work for complex types like business objects etc. Note that the preferred way to apply dependency injection to Job instances is via a JobFactory: that is, to specify SpringBeanJobFactory as Quartz JobFactory (typically via SchedulerFactoryBean.setJobFactory(org.quartz.spi.JobFactory) SchedulerFactoryBean's "jobFactory" property}). This allows to implement dependency-injected Quartz Jobs without a dependency on Spring base classes.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/quartz/QuartzJobBean.html
ResourceLoaderClassLoadHelper	A										<section class="prog__container">Wrapper that adapts from the Quartz ClassLoadHelper interface onto Spring's ResourceLoader interface. Used by default when the SchedulerFactoryBean runs in a Spring ApplicationContext.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/quartz/ResourceLoaderClassLoadHelper.html
SchedulerAccessor	A										<section class="prog__container">Common base class for accessing a Quartz Scheduler, i.e. for registering jobs, triggers and listeners on a Scheduler instance.

SchedulerContextAware	A										<section class="prog__container">Callback interface to be implemented by Spring-managed Quartz artifacts that need access to the SchedulerContext (without having natural access to it). Currently only supported for custom JobFactory implementations that are passed in via Spring's SchedulerFactoryBean.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/quartz/SchedulerContextAware.html
SchedulerFactoryBean	A										<section class="prog__container">FactoryBean that creates and configures a Quartz Scheduler, manages its lifecycle as part of the Spring application context, and exposes the Scheduler as bean reference for dependency injection. Allows registration of JobDetails, Calendars and Triggers, automatically starting the scheduler on initialization and shutting it down on destruction. In scenarios that just require static registration of jobs at startup, there is no need to access the Scheduler instance itself in application code. For dynamic registration of jobs at runtime, use a bean reference to this SchedulerFactoryBean to get direct access to the Quartz Scheduler (org.quartz.Scheduler). This allows you to create new jobs and triggers, and also to control and monitor the entire Scheduler. Note that Quartz instantiates a new Job for each execution, in contrast to Timer which uses a TimerTask instance that is shared between repeated executions. Just JobDetail descriptors are shared. When using persistent jobs, it is strongly recommended to perform all operations on the Scheduler within Spring-managed (or plain JTA) transactions. Else, database locking will not properly work and might even break. (See setDataSource javadoc for details.) The preferred way to achieve transactional execution is to demarcate declarative transactions at the business facade level, which will automatically apply to Scheduler operations performed within those scopes. Alternatively, you may add transactional advice for the Scheduler itself. Compatible with Quartz 2.1.4 and higher, as of Spring 4.1.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/quartz/SchedulerFactoryBean.html
SimpleThreadPoolTaskExecutor	A										<section class="prog__container">Subclass of Quartz's SimpleThreadPool that implements Spring's TaskExecutor interface and listens to Spring lifecycle callbacks. Can be shared between a Quartz Scheduler (specified as "taskExecutor") and other TaskExecutor users, or even used completely independent of a Quartz Scheduler (as plain TaskExecutor backend).</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/quartz/SimpleThreadPoolTaskExecutor.html
SimpleTriggerFactoryBean	A										<section class="prog__container">A Spring FactoryBean for creating a Quartz SimpleTrigger instance, supporting bean-style usage for trigger configuration. SimpleTrigger(Impl) itself is already a JavaBean but lacks sensible defaults. This class uses the Spring bean name as job name, the Quartz default group ("DEFAULT") as job group, the current time as start time, and indefinite repetition, if not specified. This class will also register the trigger with the job name and group of a given JobDetail. This allows SchedulerFactoryBean to automatically register a trigger for the corresponding JobDetail, instead of registering the JobDetail separately.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/quartz/SimpleTriggerFactoryBean.html
SpringBeanJobFactory	A										<section class="prog__container">Subclass of AdaptableJobFactory that also supports Spring-style dependency injection on bean properties. This is essentially the direct equivalent of Spring's QuartzJobBean in the shape of a Quartz JobFactory. Applies scheduler context, job data map and trigger data map entries as bean property values. If no matching bean property is found, the entry is by default simply ignored. This is analogous to QuartzJobBean's behavior. Compatible with Quartz 2.1.4 and higher, as of Spring 4.1.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/quartz/SpringBeanJobFactory.html
CronSequenceGenerator	A										<section class="prog__container">Date sequence generator for a Crontab pattern, allowing clients to specify a pattern that the sequence matches. The pattern is a list of six single space-separated fields: representing second, minute, hour, day, month, weekday. Month and weekday names can be given as the first three letters of the English names. Example patterns: "0 0 * * * *" = the top of every hour of every day."*/10 * * * * *" = every ten seconds."0 0 8-10 * * *" = 8, 9 and 10 o'clock of every day."0 * 6,19 * * *" = 6:00 AM and 7:00 PM every day."0 0/30 8-10 * * *" = 8:00, 8:30, 9:00, 9:30 and 10 o'clock every day."0 0 9-17 * * MON-FRI" = on the hour nine-to-five weekdays"0 0 0 25 12 ?" = every Christmas Day at midnight</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/support/CronSequenceGenerator.html

MethodInvokingRunnable	A										<section class="prog__container">Adapter that implements the Runnable interface as a configurable method invocation based on Spring's MethodInvoker. Inherits common configuration properties from MethodInvoker.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/support/MethodInvokingRunnable.html
PeriodicTrigger	A										<section class="prog__container">A trigger for periodic task execution. The period may be applied as either fixed-rate or fixed-delay, and an initial delay value may also be configured. The default initial delay is 0, and the default behavior is fixed-delay (i.e. the interval between successive executions is measured from each completion time). To measure the interval between the scheduled start time of each execution instead, set the 'fixedRate' property to true. Note that the TaskScheduler interface already defines methods for scheduling tasks at fixed-rate or with fixed-delay. Both also support an optional value for the initial delay. Those methods should be used directly whenever possible. The value of this Trigger implementation is that it can be used within components that rely on the Trigger abstraction. For example, it may be convenient to allow periodic triggers, cron-based triggers, and even custom Trigger implementations to be used interchangeably.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/support/PeriodicTrigger.html
ScheduledMethodRunnable	A										<section class="prog__container">Variant of MethodInvokingRunnable meant to be used for processing of no-arg scheduled methods.

ScriptFactoryPostProcessor	A										<section class="prog__container">BeanPostProcessor that handles ScriptFactory definitions, replacing each factory with the actual scripted Java object generated by it. This is similar to the FactoryBean mechanism, but is specifically tailored for scripts and not built into Spring's core container itself but rather implemented as an extension. NOTE: The most important characteristic of this post-processor is that constructor arguments are applied to the ScriptFactory instance while bean property values are applied to the generated scripted object. Typically, constructor arguments include a script source locator and potentially script interfaces, while bean property values include references and config values to inject into the scripted object itself. The following ScriptFactoryPostProcessor will automatically be applied to the two ScriptFactory definitions below. At runtime, the actual scripted objects will be exposed for "bshMessenger" and "groovyMessenger", rather than the ScriptFactory instances. Both of those are supposed to be castable to the example's Messenger interfaces here. <bean class="org.springframework.scripting.support.ScriptFactoryPostProcessor"/> <bean id="bshMessenger" class="org.springframework.scripting.bsh.BshScriptFactory">   <constructor-arg value="classpath:mypackage/Messenger.bsh"/>   <constructor-arg value="mypackage.Messenger"/>   <property name="message" value="Hello World!"/> </bean> <bean id="groovyMessenger" class="org.springframework.scripting.groovy.GroovyScriptFactory">   <constructor-arg value="classpath:mypackage/Messenger.groovy"/>   <property name="message" value="Hello World!"/> </bean>NOTE: Please note that the above excerpt from a Spring XML bean definition file uses just the <bean/>-style syntax (in an effort to illustrate using the ScriptFactoryPostProcessor itself). In reality, you would never create a <bean/> definition for a ScriptFactoryPostProcessor explicitly; rather you would import the tags from the 'lang' namespace and simply create scripted beans using the tags in that namespace... as part of doing so, a ScriptFactoryPostProcessor will implicitly be created for you. The Spring reference documentation contains numerous examples of using tags in the 'lang' namespace; by way of an example, find below a Groovy-backed bean defined using the 'lang:groovy' tag.  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"     xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"     xmlns:lang="http://www.springframework.org/schema/lang">   <!-- this is the bean definition for the Groovy-backed Messenger implementation -->   <lang:groovy id="messenger" script-source="classpath:Messenger.groovy">     <lang:property name="message" value="I Can Do The Frug" />   </lang:groovy>   <!-- an otherwise normal bean that will be injected by the Groovy-backed Messenger -->   <bean id="bookingService" class="x.y.DefaultBookingService">     <property name="messenger" ref="messenger" />   </bean> </beans></section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scripting/support/ScriptFactoryPostProcessor.html
StandardScriptEvalException	A										<section class="prog__container">Exception decorating a ScriptException coming out of JSR-223 script evaluation, i.e. a ScriptEngine.eval(java.lang.String, javax.script.ScriptContext) call or Invocable.invokeMethod(java.lang.Object, java.lang.String, java.lang.Object...) / Invocable.invokeFunction(java.lang.String, java.lang.Object...) call. This exception does not print the Java stacktrace, since the JSR-223 ScriptException results in a rather convoluted text output. From that perspective, this exception is primarily a decorator for a ScriptException root cause passed into an outer exception.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scripting/support/StandardScriptEvalException.html

Other class-level annotations may be considered as identifying a component as well, typically a special kind of component: e.g. the @Repository annotation or AspectJ's @Aspect annotation.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/stereotype/Component.html
Controller	A										<section class="prog__container">Indicates that an annotated class is a "Controller" (e.g. a web controller). This annotation serves as a specialization of @Component, allowing for implementation classes to be autodetected through classpath scanning. It is typically used in combination with annotated handler methods based on the RequestMapping annotation.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/stereotype/Controller.html
Repository	A										<section class="prog__container">Indicates that an annotated class is a "Repository", originally defined by Domain-Driven Design (Evans, 2003) as "a mechanism for encapsulating storage, retrieval, and search behavior which emulates a collection of objects". Teams implementing traditional J2EE patterns such as "Data Access Object" may also apply this stereotype to DAO classes, though care should be taken to understand the distinction between Data Access Object and DDD-style repositories before doing so. This annotation is a general-purpose stereotype and individual teams may narrow their semantics and use as appropriate. A class thus annotated is eligible for Spring DataAccessException translation when used in conjunction with a PersistenceExceptionTranslationPostProcessor. The annotated class is also clarified as to its role in the overall application architecture for the purpose of tooling, aspects, etc. As of Spring 2.5, this annotation also serves as a specialization of @Component, allowing for implementation classes to be autodetected through classpath scanning.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/stereotype/Repository.html
Service	A										<section class="prog__container">Indicates that an annotated class is a "Service", originally defined by Domain-Driven Design (Evans, 2003) as "an operation offered as an interface that stands alone in the model, with no encapsulated state." May also indicate that a class is a "Business Service Facade" (in the Core J2EE patterns sense), or something similar. This annotation is a general-purpose stereotype and individual teams may narrow their semantics and use as appropriate. This annotation serves as a specialization of @Component, allowing for implementation classes to be autodetected through classpath scanning.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/stereotype/Service.html
Commit	A										<section class="prog__container">@Commit is a test annotation that is used to indicate that a test-managed transaction should be committed after the test method has completed. Consult the class-level Javadoc for TransactionalTestExecutionListener for an explanation of test-managed transactions. When declared as a class-level annotation, @Commit defines the default commit semantics for all test methods within the test class hierarchy. When declared as a method-level annotation, @Commit defines commit semantics for the specific test method, potentially overriding class-level default commit or rollback semantics. Warning: @Commit can be used as direct replacement for @Rollback(false); however, it should not be declared alongside @Rollback. Declaring @Commit and @Rollback on the same test method or on the same test class is unsupported and may lead to unpredictable results.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/test/annotation/Commit.html

DirtiesContext	A										<section class="prog__container">Test annotation which indicates that the ApplicationContext associated with a test is dirty and should therefore be closed and removed from the context cache. Use this annotation if a test has modified the context — for example, by modifying the state of a singleton bean, modifying the state of an embedded database, etc. Subsequent tests that request the same context will be supplied a new context. @DirtiesContext may be used as a class-level and method-level annotation within the same class or class hierarchy. In such scenarios, the ApplicationContext will be marked as dirty before or after any such annotated method as well as before or after the current test class, depending on the configured methodMode() and classMode(). As of Spring Framework 4.0, this annotation may be used as a meta-annotation to create custom composed annotations. Supported Test PhasesBefore current test class: when declared at the class level with class mode set to BEFORE_CLASSBefore each test method in current test class: when declared at the class level with class mode set to BEFORE_EACH_TEST_METHODBefore current test method: when declared at the method level with method mode set to BEFORE_METHODAfter current test method: when declared at the method level with method mode set to AFTER_METHODAfter each test method in current test class: when declared at the class level with class mode set to AFTER_EACH_TEST_METHODAfter current test class: when declared at the class level with class mode set to AFTER_CLASSBEFORE_* modes are supported by the DirtiesContextBeforeModesTestExecutionListener; AFTER_* modes are supported by the DirtiesContextTestExecutionListener.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/test/annotation/DirtiesContext.html

IfProfileValue	A										<section class="prog__container">Test annotation to indicate whether a test is enabled or disabled for a specific testing profile. In the context of this annotation, the term profile refers to a Java system property by default; however, the semantics can be changed by implementing a custom ProfileValueSource. If the configured ProfileValueSource returns a matching value() for the declared name(), the test will be enabled. Otherwise, the test will be disabled and effectively ignored. @IfProfileValue can be applied at the class level, the method level, or both. Class-level usage of @IfProfileValue takes precedence over method-level usage for any methods within that class or its subclasses. Specifically, a test is enabled if it is enabled both at the class level and at the method level; the absence of @IfProfileValue means the test is implicitly enabled. This is analogous to the semantics of JUnit's @Ignore annotation, except that the presence of @Ignore always disables a test. Example When using SystemProfileValueSource as the ProfileValueSource implementation (which is configured by default), you can configure a test method to run only on Java VMs from Oracle as follows:  @IfProfileValue(name = "java.vendor", value = "Oracle Corporation") public void testSomething() {     // ... }'OR' SemanticsYou can alternatively configure @IfProfileValue with OR semantics for multiple values(). The following test will be enabled if a ProfileValueSource has been appropriately configured for the "test-groups" profile with a value of either unit-testsor integration-tests. This functionality is similar to TestNG's support for test groups and JUnit's experimental support for test categories.  @IfProfileValue(name = "test-groups", values = { "unit-tests", "integration-tests" }) public void testWhichRunsForUnitOrIntegrationTestGroups() {     // ... }@IfProfileValue vs. @ProfileAlthough the @IfProfileValue and @Profile annotations both involve profiles, they are not directly related. @Profile involves bean definition profiles configured in the Environment; whereas, @IfProfileValue is used to enable or disable tests.

When declared as a class-level annotation, @Rollback defines the default rollback semantics for all test methods within the test class hierarchy. When declared as a method-level annotation, @Rollback defines rollback semantics for the specific test method, potentially overriding class-level default commit or rollback semantics. As of Spring Framework 4.2, @Commit can be used as direct replacement for @Rollback(false).

ContextConfiguration	A										<section class="prog__container">@ContextConfiguration defines class-level metadata that is used to determine how to load and configure an ApplicationContext for integration tests. Supported Resource Types Prior to Spring 3.1, only path-based resource locations (typically XML configuration files) were supported. As of Spring 3.1, context loaders may choose to support either path-based or class-based resources. As of Spring 4.0.4, context loaders may choose to support path-based and class-based resources simultaneously. Consequently @ContextConfiguration can be used to declare either path-based resource locations (via the locations() or value() attribute) or annotated classes (via the classes() attribute). Note, however, that most implementations of SmartContextLoader only support a single resource type. As of Spring 4.1, path-based resource locations may be either XML configuration files or Groovy scripts (if Groovy is on the classpath). Of course, third-party frameworks may choose to support additional types of path-based resources. Annotated Classes The term annotated class can refer to any of the following. A class annotated with @ConfigurationA component (i.e., a class annotated with @Component, @Service, @Repository, etc.)A JSR-330 compliant class that is annotated with javax.inject annotationsAny other class that contains @Bean-methods Consult the Javadoc for @Configuration and @Bean for further information regarding the configuration and semantics of annotated classes.

ContextHierarchy	A										<section class="prog__container">@ContextHierarchy is a class-level annotation that is used to define a hierarchy of ApplicationContexts for integration tests. ExamplesThe following JUnit-based examples demonstrate common configuration scenarios for integration tests that require the use of context hierarchies. Single Test Class with Context HierarchyControllerIntegrationTests represents a typical integration testing scenario for a Spring MVC web application by declaring a context hierarchy consisting of two levels, one for the root WebApplicationContext (with TestAppConfig) and one for the dispatcher servletWebApplicationContext (with WebConfig). The WebApplicationContext that is autowired into the test instance is the one for the child context (i.e., the lowest context in the hierarchy).  @RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class) @WebAppConfiguration @ContextHierarchy({     @ContextConfiguration(classes = TestAppConfig.class),     @ContextConfiguration(classes = WebConfig.class) }) public class ControllerIntegrationTests {     @Autowired     private WebApplicationContext wac;     // ... }Class Hierarchy with Implicit Parent ContextThe following test classes define a context hierarchy within a test class hierarchy. AbstractWebTests declares the configuration for a root WebApplicationContext in a Spring-powered web application. Note, however, that AbstractWebTests does not declare @ContextHierarchy; consequently, subclasses of AbstractWebTests can optionally participate in a context hierarchy or follow the standard semantics for @ContextConfiguration. SoapWebServiceTests and RestWebServiceTests both extend AbstractWebTests and define a context hierarchy via @ContextHierarchy. The result is that three application contexts will be loaded (one for each declaration of @ContextConfiguration, and the application context loaded based on the configuration in AbstractWebTests will be set as the parent context for each of the contexts loaded for the concrete subclasses.  @RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class) @WebAppConfiguration @ContextConfiguration("file:src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/applicationContext.xml") public abstract class AbstractWebTests {} @ContextHierarchy(@ContextConfiguration("/spring/soap-ws-config.xml") public class SoapWebServiceTests extends AbstractWebTests {} @ContextHierarchy(@ContextConfiguration("/spring/rest-ws-config.xml") public class RestWebServiceTests extends AbstractWebTests {}Class Hierarchy with Merged Context Hierarchy ConfigurationThe following classes demonstrate the use of named hierarchy levels in order to merge the configuration for specific levels in a context hierarchy. BaseTests defines two levels in the hierarchy, parent and child. ExtendedTests extends BaseTests and instructs the Spring TestContext Framework to merge the context configuration for the child hierarchy level, simply by ensuring that the names declared via ContextConfiguration.name() are both "child". The result is that three application contexts will be loaded: one for "/app-config.xml", one for "/user-config.xml", and one for {"/user-config.xml", "/order-config.xml"}. As with the previous example, the application context loaded from "/app-config.xml" will be set as the parent context for the contexts loaded from "/user-config.xml" and {"/user-config.xml", "/order-config.xml"}.  @RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class) @ContextHierarchy({     @ContextConfiguration(name = "parent", locations = "/app-config.xml"),     @ContextConfiguration(name = "child",  locations = "/user-config.xml") }) public class BaseTests {} @ContextHierarchy(     @ContextConfiguration(name = "child",  locations = "/order-config.xml") ) public class ExtendedTests extends BaseTests {}Class Hierarchy with Overridden Context Hierarchy ConfigurationIn contrast to the previous example, this example demonstrates how to override the configuration for a given named level in a context hierarchy by setting the ContextConfiguration.inheritLocations() flag to false. Consequently, the application context for ExtendedTests will be loaded only from "/test-user-config.xml" and will have its parent set to the context loaded from "/app-config.xml".  @RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class) @ContextHierarchy({     @ContextConfiguration(name = "parent", locations = "/app-config.xml"),     @ContextConfiguration(name = "child",  locations = "/user-config.xml") }) public class BaseTests {} @ContextHierarchy(     @ContextConfiguration(name = "child",  locations = "/test-user-config.xml", inheritLocations=false) ) public class ExtendedTests extends BaseTests {}As of Spring Framework 4.0, this annotation may be used as a meta-annotation to create custom composed annotations.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/test/context/ContextHierarchy.html
ContextLoader	A										<section class="prog__container">Strategy interface for loading an application context for an integration test managed by the Spring TestContext Framework. Note: as of Spring 3.1, implement SmartContextLoader instead of this interface in order to provide support for annotated classes, active bean definition profiles, and application context initializers. Clients of a ContextLoader should call processLocations() prior to calling loadContext() in case the ContextLoader provides custom support for modifying or generating locations. The results of processLocations() should then be supplied to loadContext(). Concrete implementations must provide a public no-args constructor.

MergedContextConfiguration	A										<section class="prog__container">MergedContextConfiguration encapsulates the merged context configuration declared on a test class and all of its superclasses via @ContextConfiguration, @ActiveProfiles, and @TestPropertySource. Merged context resource locations, annotated classes, active profiles, property resource locations, and in-lined properties represent all declared values in the test class hierarchy taking into consideration the semantics of the ContextConfiguration.inheritLocations(), ActiveProfiles.inheritProfiles(), TestPropertySource.inheritLocations(), and TestPropertySource.inheritProperties() flags. A SmartContextLoader uses MergedContextConfiguration to load an ApplicationContext. MergedContextConfiguration is also used by the ContextCache as the key for caching an ApplicationContext that was loaded using properties of this MergedContextConfiguration.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/test/context/MergedContextConfiguration.html
SmartContextLoader	A										<section class="prog__container">Strategy interface for loading an application context for an integration test managed by the Spring TestContext Framework. The SmartContextLoader SPI supersedes the ContextLoader SPI introduced in Spring 2.5: a SmartContextLoader can choose to process either resource locations or annotated classes. Furthermore, a SmartContextLoader can set active bean definition profiles in the context that it loads (see MergedContextConfiguration.getActiveProfiles() and loadContext(MergedContextConfiguration)). See the Javadoc for @ContextConfiguration for a definition of annotated class. Clients of a SmartContextLoader should call processContextConfiguration() prior to calling loadContext(). This gives a SmartContextLoader the opportunity to provide custom support for modifying resource locations or detecting default resource locations or default configuration classes. The results of processContextConfiguration() should be merged for all classes in the hierarchy of the root test class and then supplied to loadContext(). Even though SmartContextLoader extends ContextLoader, clients should favor SmartContextLoader-specific methods over those defined in ContextLoader, particularly because a SmartContextLoader may choose not to support methods defined in the ContextLoader SPI.

ConfigurationA custom bootstrapping strategy can be configured for a test class (or test class hierarchy) via @BootstrapWith, either directly or as a meta-annotation. If a bootstrapper is not explicitly configured via @BootstrapWith, either the DefaultTestContextBootstrapper or the WebTestContextBootstrapper will be used, depending on the presence of @WebAppConfiguration. Implementation NotesConcrete implementations must provide a public no-args constructor. WARNING: this SPI will likely change in the future in order to accommodate new requirements. Implementers are therefore strongly encouraged not to implement this interface directly but rather to extendAbstractTestContextBootstrapper or one of its concrete subclasses instead.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/test/context/TestContextBootstrapper.html
TestContextManager	A										<section class="prog__container">TestContextManager is the main entry point into the Spring TestContext Framework.

TestPropertySource	A										<section class="prog__container">@TestPropertySource is a class-level annotation that is used to configure the locations() of properties files and inlined properties() to be added to the Environment's set of PropertySources for an ApplicationContext for integration tests. PrecedenceTest property sources have higher precedence than those loaded from the operating system's environment or Java system properties as well as property sources added by the application declaratively via @PropertySource or programmatically (e.g., via an ApplicationContextInitializer or some other means). Thus, test property sources can be used to selectively override properties defined in system and application property sources. Furthermore, inlined properties() have higher precedence than properties loaded from resource locations(). Default Properties File DetectionIf @TestPropertySource is declared as an empty annotation (i.e., without explicit values for locations() or properties()), an attempt will be made to detect a default properties file relative to the class that declared the annotation. For example, if the annotated test class is com.example.MyTest, the corresponding default properties file is "classpath:com/example/MyTest.properties". If the default cannot be detected, an IllegalStateException will be thrown. Enabling @TestPropertySource@TestPropertySource is enabled if the configured context loader honors it. Every SmartContextLoader that is a subclass of either AbstractGenericContextLoader or AbstractGenericWebContextLoader provides automatic support for @TestPropertySource, and this includes every SmartContextLoader provided by the Spring TestContext Framework. MiscellaneousTypically, @TestPropertySource will be used in conjunction with @ContextConfiguration.This annotation may be used as a meta-annotation to create custom composed annotations; however, caution should be taken if this annotation and @ContextConfiguration are combined on a composed annotation since the locations and inheritLocations attributes of both annotations can lead to ambiguity during the attribute resolution process.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/test/context/TestPropertySource.html
ContextCache	A										<section class="prog__container">ContextCache defines the SPI for caching Spring ApplicationContexts within the Spring TestContext Framework. A ContextCache maintains a cache of ApplicationContexts keyed by MergedContextConfiguration instances, potentially configured with a maximum size and a custom eviction policy. RationaleContext caching can have significant performance benefits if context initialization is complex. Although the initialization of a Spring context itself is typically very quick, some beans in a context — for example, an embedded database or a LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean for working with JPA — may take several seconds to initialize.

SqlConfig	A										<section class="prog__container">@SqlConfig defines metadata that is used to determine how to parse and execute SQL scripts configured via the @Sql annotation. Configuration ScopeWhen declared as a class-level annotation on an integration test class, @SqlConfig serves as global configuration for all SQL scripts within the test class hierarchy. When declared directly via the config attribute of the @Sql annotation, @SqlConfig serves as local configuration for the SQL scripts declared within the enclosing @Sql annotation. Default ValuesEvery attribute in @SqlConfig has an implicit default value which is documented in the javadocs of the corresponding attribute. Due to the rules defined for annotation attributes in the Java Language Specification, it is unfortunately not possible to assign a value of null to an annotation attribute. Thus, in order to support overrides of inherited global configuration, @SqlConfig attributes have an explicitdefault value of either "" for Strings or DEFAULT for Enums. This approach allows local declarations of @SqlConfig to selectively override individual attributes from global declarations of @SqlConfig by providing a value other than "" or DEFAULT. Inheritance and OverridesGlobal @SqlConfig attributes are inherited whenever local @SqlConfig attributes do not supply an explicit value other than "" or DEFAULT. Explicit local configuration therefore overrides global configuration.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/test/context/jdbc/SqlConfig.html

AbstractDelegatingSmartContextLoader	A										<section class="prog__container">AbstractDelegatingSmartContextLoader serves as an abstract base class for implementations of the SmartContextLoader SPI that delegate to a set of candidate SmartContextLoaders (i.e., one that supports XML configuration files or Groovy scripts and one that supports annotated classes) to determine which context loader is appropriate for a given test class's configuration. Each candidate is given a chance to process the ContextConfigurationAttributes for each class in the test class hierarchy that is annotated with @ContextConfiguration, and the candidate that supports the merged, processed configuration will be used to actually load the context. Any reference to an XML-based loader can be interpreted to mean a context loader that supports only XML configuration files or one that supports both XML configuration files and Groovy scripts simultaneously. Placing an empty @ContextConfiguration annotation on a test class signals that default resource locations (e.g., XML configuration files or Groovy scripts) or default configuration classes should be detected. Furthermore, if a specific ContextLoader or SmartContextLoader is not explicitly declared via @ContextConfiguration, a concrete subclass of AbstractDelegatingSmartContextLoader will be used as the default loader, thus providing automatic support for either path-based resource locations (e.g., XML configuration files and Groovy scripts) or annotated classes, but not both simultaneously. As of Spring 3.2, a test class may optionally declare neither path-based resource locations nor annotated classes and instead declare only application context initializers. In such cases, an attempt will still be made to detect defaults, but their absence will not result in an exception.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/test/context/support/AbstractDelegatingSmartContextLoader.html

TransactionalTestExecutionListener	A										<section class="prog__container">TestExecutionListener that provides support for executing tests within test-managed transactions by honoring Spring's @Transactional annotation. Test-managed TransactionsTest-managed transactions are transactions that are managed declaratively via this listener or programmatically via TestTransaction. Such transactions should not be confused with Spring-managed transactions (i.e., those managed directly by Spring within the ApplicationContext loaded for tests) or application-managed transactions (i.e., those managed programmatically within application code that is invoked via tests). Spring-managed and application-managed transactions will typically participate in test-managed transactions; however, caution should be taken if Spring-managed or application-managed transactions are configured with any propagation type other than REQUIRED or SUPPORTS. Enabling and Disabling TransactionsAnnotating a test method with @Transactional causes the test to be run within a transaction that will, by default, be automatically rolled back after completion of the test. If a test class is annotated with @Transactional, each test method within that class hierarchy will be run within a transaction. Test methods that are not annotated with @Transactional (at the class or method level) will not be run within a transaction. Furthermore, tests that are annotated with @Transactional but have the propagation type set to NOT_SUPPORTED will not be run within a transaction. Declarative Rollback and Commit BehaviorBy default, test transactions will be automatically rolled back after completion of the test; however, transactional commit and rollback behavior can be configured declaratively via the @Commit and @Rollback annotations at the class level and at the method level. Programmatic Transaction ManagementAs of Spring Framework 4.1, it is possible to interact with test-managed transactions programmatically via the static methods in TestTransaction. TestTransaction may be used within test methods, before methods, and after methods. Executing Code outside of a TransactionWhen executing transactional tests, it is sometimes useful to be able to execute certain set up or tear down code outside of a transaction. TransactionalTestExecutionListener provides such support for methods annotated with @BeforeTransaction or @AfterTransaction. As of Spring Framework 4.3, @BeforeTransaction and @AfterTransaction may also be declared on Java 8 based interface default methods. Configuring a Transaction ManagerTransactionalTestExecutionListener expects a PlatformTransactionManager bean to be defined in the Spring ApplicationContext for the test. In case there are multiple instances of PlatformTransactionManager within the test's ApplicationContext, a qualifier may be declared via @Transactional (e.g., @Transactional("myTxMgr") or @Transactional(transactionManger = "myTxMgr"), or TransactionManagementConfigurer can be implemented by an @Configuration class. See TestContextTransactionUtils.retrieveTransactionManager(org.springframework.test.context.TestContext, java.lang.String) for details on the algorithm used to look up a transaction manager in the test's ApplicationContext.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/test/context/transaction/TransactionalTestExecutionListener.html

ServletTestExecutionListener	A										<section class="prog__container">TestExecutionListener which provides mock Servlet API support to WebApplicationContexts loaded by the Spring TestContext Framework. Specifically, ServletTestExecutionListener sets up thread-local state via Spring Web's RequestContextHolder during test instance preparation and before each test method and creates a MockHttpServletRequest, MockHttpServletResponse, and ServletWebRequest based on the MockServletContext present in the WebApplicationContext. This listener also ensures that the MockHttpServletResponse and ServletWebRequest can be injected into the test instance, and once the test is complete this listener cleans up thread-local state. Note that ServletTestExecutionListener is enabled by default but generally takes no action if the test class is not annotated with @WebAppConfiguration. See the javadocs for individual methods in this class for details.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/test/context/web/ServletTestExecutionListener.html
WebAppConfiguration	A										<section class="prog__container">@WebAppConfiguration is a class-level annotation that is used to declare that the ApplicationContext loaded for an integration test should be a WebApplicationContext.

To override the default, specify an explicit resource path via the value() attribute. Note that @WebAppConfiguration must be used in conjunction with @ContextConfiguration, either within a single test class or within a test class hierarchy. As of Spring Framework 4.0, this annotation may be used as a meta-annotation to create custom composed annotations.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/test/context/web/WebAppConfiguration.html
WebDelegatingSmartContextLoader	A										<section class="prog__container">WebDelegatingSmartContextLoader is a concrete implementation of AbstractDelegatingSmartContextLoader that delegates to a GenericXmlWebContextLoader (or a GenericGroovyXmlWebContextLoader if Groovy is present on the classpath) and an AnnotationConfigWebContextLoader.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/test/context/web/WebDelegatingSmartContextLoader.html

StandaloneMockMvcBuilder	A										<section class="prog__container">A MockMvcBuilder that accepts @Controller registrations thus allowing full control over the instantiation and initialization of controllers and their dependencies similar to plain unit tests, and also making it possible to test one controller at a time. This builder creates the minimum infrastructure required by the DispatcherServlet to serve requests with annotated controllers and also provides methods for customization. The resulting configuration and customization options are equivalent to using MVC Java config except using builder style methods. To configure view resolution, either select a "fixed" view to use for every request performed (see setSingleView(View)) or provide a list of ViewResolvers (see setViewResolvers(ViewResolver...)).</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/test/web/servlet/setup/StandaloneMockMvcBuilder.html

This represents an illegal usage of the transaction API.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/NoTransactionException.html
PlatformTransactionManager	A										<section class="prog__container">This is the central interface in Spring's transaction infrastructure. Applications can use this directly, but it is not primarily meant as API: Typically, applications will work with either TransactionTemplate or declarative transaction demarcation through AOP. For implementors, it is recommended to derive from the provided AbstractPlatformTransactionManager class, which pre-implements the defined propagation behavior and takes care of transaction synchronization handling. Subclasses have to implement template methods for specific states of the underlying transaction, for example: begin, suspend, resume, commit. The default implementations of this strategy interface are JtaTransactionManager and DataSourceTransactionManager, which can serve as an implementation guide for other transaction strategies.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/PlatformTransactionManager.html
SavepointManager	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface that specifies an API to programmatically manage transaction savepoints in a generic fashion. Extended by TransactionStatus to expose savepoint management functionality for a specific transaction. Note that savepoints can only work within an active transaction. Just use this programmatic savepoint handling for advanced needs; else, a subtransaction with PROPAGATION_NESTED is preferable. This interface is inspired by JDBC 3.0's Savepoint mechanism but is independent from any specific persistence technology.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/SavepointManager.html
TransactionDefinition	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface that defines Spring-compliant transaction properties. Based on the propagation behavior definitions analogous to EJB CMT attributes. Note that isolation level and timeout settings will not get applied unless an actual new transaction gets started. As only PROPAGATION_REQUIRED, PROPAGATION_REQUIRES_NEW and PROPAGATION_NESTED can cause that, it usually doesn't make sense to specify those settings in other cases. Furthermore, be aware that not all transaction managers will support those advanced features and thus might throw corresponding exceptions when given non-default values. The read-only flag applies to any transaction context, whether backed by an actual resource transaction or operating non-transactionally at the resource level. In the latter case, the flag will only apply to managed resources within the application, such as a Hibernate Session.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/TransactionDefinition.html

TransactionStatus	A										<section class="prog__container">Representation of the status of a transaction. Transactional code can use this to retrieve status information, and to programmatically request a rollback (instead of throwing an exception that causes an implicit rollback). Derives from the SavepointManager interface to provide access to savepoint management facilities. Note that savepoint management is only available if supported by the underlying transaction manager.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/TransactionStatus.html
TransactionSuspensionNotSupportedException	A										<section class="prog__container">Exception thrown when attempting to suspend an existing transaction but transaction suspension is not supported by the underlying backend.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/TransactionSuspensionNotSupportedException.html

TransactionTimedOutException	A										<section class="prog__container">Exception to be thrown when a transaction has timed out. Thrown by Spring's local transaction strategies if the deadline for a transaction has been reached when an operation is attempted, according to the timeout specified for the given transaction. Beyond such checks before each transactional operation, Spring's local transaction strategies will also pass appropriate timeout values to resource operations (for example to JDBC Statements, letting the JDBC driver respect the timeout). Such operations will usually throw native resource exceptions (for example, JDBC SQLExceptions) if their operation timeout has been exceeded, to be converted to Spring's DataAccessException in the respective DAO (which might use Spring's JdbcTemplate, for example). In a JTA environment, it is up to the JTA transaction coordinator to apply transaction timeouts. Usually, the corresponding JTA-aware connection pool will perform timeout checks and throw corresponding native resource exceptions (for example, JDBC SQLExceptions).</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/TransactionTimedOutException.html

AnnotationTransactionAttributeSource	A										<section class="prog__container">Implementation of the TransactionAttributeSource interface for working with transaction metadata in JDK 1.5+ annotation format. This class reads Spring's JDK 1.5+ Transactional annotation and exposes corresponding transaction attributes to Spring's transaction infrastructure. Also supports JTA 1.2's Transactional and EJB3's TransactionAttribute annotation (if present). This class may also serve as base class for a custom TransactionAttributeSource, or get customized through TransactionAnnotationParser strategies.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/annotation/AnnotationTransactionAttributeSource.html
Ejb3TransactionAnnotationParser	A										<section class="prog__container">Strategy implementation for parsing EJB3's TransactionAttribute annotation.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/annotation/Ejb3TransactionAnnotationParser.html
EnableTransactionManagement	A										<section class="prog__container">Enables Spring's annotation-driven transaction management capability, similar to the support found in Spring's <tx:*> XML namespace. To be used on @Configuration classes as follows:  @Configuration @EnableTransactionManagement public class AppConfig {     @Bean     public FooRepository fooRepository() {         // configure and return a class having @Transactional methods         return new JdbcFooRepository(dataSource());     }     @Bean     public DataSource dataSource() {         // configure and return the necessary JDBC DataSource     }     @Bean     public PlatformTransactionManager txManager() {         return new DataSourceTransactionManager(dataSource());     } }For reference, the example above can be compared to the following Spring XML configuration:  <beans>     <tx:annotation-driven/>     <bean id="fooRepository" class="com.foo.JdbcFooRepository">         <constructor-arg ref="dataSource"/>     </bean>     <bean id="dataSource" class="com.vendor.VendorDataSource"/>     <bean id="transactionManager" class="org.sfwk...DataSourceTransactionManager">         <constructor-arg ref="dataSource"/>     </bean> </beans>  In both of the scenarios above, @EnableTransactionManagement and <tx:annotation-driven/> are responsible for registering the necessary Spring components that power annotation-driven transaction management, such as the TransactionInterceptor and the proxy- or AspectJ-based advice that weave the interceptor into the call stack when JdbcFooRepository's @Transactional methods are invoked. A minor difference between the two examples lies in the naming of the PlatformTransactionManager bean: In the @Bean case, the name is "txManager" (per the name of the method); in the XML case, the name is "transactionManager". The <tx:annotation-driven/> is hard-wired to look for a bean named "transactionManager" by default, however @EnableTransactionManagement is more flexible; it will fall back to a by-type lookup for any PlatformTransactionManager bean in the container. Thus the name can be "txManager", "transactionManager", or "tm": it simply does not matter. For those that wish to establish a more direct relationship between @EnableTransactionManagement and the exact transaction manager bean to be used, the TransactionManagementConfigurer callback interface may be implemented - notice the implements clause and the @Override-annotated method below:  @Configuration @EnableTransactionManagement public class AppConfig implements TransactionManagementConfigurer {     @Bean     public FooRepository fooRepository() {         // configure and return a class having @Transactional methods         return new JdbcFooRepository(dataSource());     }     @Bean     public DataSource dataSource() {         // configure and return the necessary JDBC DataSource     }     @Bean     public PlatformTransactionManager txManager() {         return new DataSourceTransactionManager(dataSource());     }     @Override     public PlatformTransactionManager annotationDrivenTransactionManager() {         return txManager();     } } This approach may be desirable simply because it is more explicit, or it may be necessary in order to distinguish between two PlatformTransactionManager beans present in the same container.  As the name suggests, the annotationDrivenTransactionManager() will be the one used for processing @Transactional methods. See TransactionManagementConfigurer Javadoc for further details. The mode() attribute controls how advice is applied; if the mode is AdviceMode.PROXY (the default), then the other attributes control the behavior of the proxying. If the mode() is set to AdviceMode.ASPECTJ, then the proxyTargetClass() attribute is obsolete. Note also that in this case the spring-aspects module JAR must be present on the classpath.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/annotation/EnableTransactionManagement.html
Isolation	A										<section class="prog__container">Enumeration that represents transaction isolation levels for use with the Transactional annotation, corresponding to the TransactionDefinition interface.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/annotation/Isolation.html

Transactional	A										<section class="prog__container">Describes transaction attributes on a method or class. This annotation type is generally directly comparable to Spring's RuleBasedTransactionAttribute class, and in fact AnnotationTransactionAttributeSource will directly convert the data to the latter class, so that Spring's transaction support code does not have to know about annotations. If no rules are relevant to the exception, it will be treated like DefaultTransactionAttribute (rolling back on runtime exceptions). For specific information about the semantics of this annotation's attributes, consult the TransactionDefinition and TransactionAttribute javadocs.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/annotation/Transactional.html
TransactionAnnotationParser	A										<section class="prog__container">Strategy interface for parsing known transaction annotation types.

TransactionManagementConfigurer	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface to be implemented by @Configuration classes annotated with @EnableTransactionManagement that wish to or need to explicitly specify the default PlatformTransactionManager bean to be used for annotation-driven transaction management, as opposed to the default approach of a by-type lookup. One reason this might be necessary is if there are two PlatformTransactionManager beans present in the container. See @EnableTransactionManagement for general examples and context; see annotationDrivenTransactionManager() for detailed instructions. Note that in by-type lookup disambiguation cases, an alternative approach to implementing this interface is to simply mark one of the offending PlatformTransactionManager @Bean methods as @Primary. This is even generally preferred since it doesn't lead to early initialization of the PlatformTransactionManager bean.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/annotation/TransactionManagementConfigurer.html
AspectJTransactionManagementConfiguration	A										<section class="prog__container">@Configuration class that registers the Spring infrastructure beans necessary to enable AspectJ-based annotation-driven transaction management.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/aspectj/AspectJTransactionManagementConfiguration.html

TxNamespaceHandler	A										<section class="prog__container">NamespaceHandler allowing for the configuration of declarative transaction management using either XML or using annotations. This namespace handler is the central piece of functionality in the Spring transaction management facilities and offers two approaches to declaratively manage transactions. One approach uses transaction semantics defined in XML using the <tx:advice> elements, the other uses annotations in combination with the <tx:annotation-driven> element. Both approached are detailed to great extent in the Spring reference manual.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/config/TxNamespaceHandler.html
TransactionalEventListener	A										<section class="prog__container">An EventListener that is invoked according to a TransactionPhase. If the event is not published within the boundaries of a managed transaction, the event is discarded unless the fallbackExecution() flag is explicitly set. If a transaction is running, the event is processed according to its TransactionPhase. Adding @Order on your annotated method allows you to prioritize that listener amongst other listeners running in the same phase.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/event/TransactionalEventListener.html

AbstractFallbackTransactionAttributeSource	A										<section class="prog__container">Abstract implementation of TransactionAttributeSource that caches attributes for methods and implements a fallback policy: 1. specific target method; 2. target class; 3. declaring method; 4. declaring class/interface. Defaults to using the target class's transaction attribute if none is associated with the target method. Any transaction attribute associated with the target method completely overrides a class transaction attribute. If none found on the target class, the interface that the invoked method has been called through (in case of a JDK proxy) will be checked. This implementation caches attributes by method after they are first used. If it is ever desirable to allow dynamic changing of transaction attributes (which is very unlikely), caching could be made configurable. Caching is desirable because of the cost of evaluating rollback rules.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/interceptor/AbstractFallbackTransactionAttributeSource.html

TransactionAspectSupport	A										<section class="prog__container">Base class for transactional aspects, such as the TransactionInterceptor or an AspectJ aspect. This enables the underlying Spring transaction infrastructure to be used easily to implement an aspect for any aspect system. Subclasses are responsible for calling methods in this class in the correct order. If no transaction name has been specified in the TransactionAttribute, the exposed name will be the fully-qualified class name + "." + method name (by default). Uses the Strategy design pattern. A PlatformTransactionManager implementation will perform the actual transaction management, and a TransactionAttributeSource is used for determining transaction definitions. A transaction aspect is serializable if its PlatformTransactionManager and TransactionAttributeSource are serializable.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/interceptor/TransactionAspectSupport.html

TransactionAttributeEditor	A										<section class="prog__container">PropertyEditor for TransactionAttribute objects. Accepts a String of form PROPAGATION_NAME, ISOLATION_NAME, readOnly, timeout_NNNN,+Exception1,-Exception2where only propagation code is required. For example: PROPAGATION_MANDATORY, ISOLATION_DEFAULTThe tokens can be in any order. Propagation and isolation codes must use the names of the constants in the TransactionDefinition class. Timeout values are in seconds. If no timeout is specified, the transaction manager will apply a default timeout specific to the particular transaction manager. A "+" before an exception name substring indicates that transactions should commit even if this exception is thrown; a "-" that they should roll back.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/interceptor/TransactionAttributeEditor.html

TransactionAttributeSourceAdvisor	A										<section class="prog__container">Advisor driven by a TransactionAttributeSource, used to include a TransactionInterceptor only for methods that are transactional.

Note: Will register all overloaded methods for a given name. Does not support explicit registration of certain overloaded methods. Supports "xxx*" mappings, e.g. "notify*" for "notify" and "notifyAll".</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/interceptor/TransactionAttributeSourceEditor.html
TransactionInterceptor	A										<section class="prog__container">AOP Alliance MethodInterceptor for declarative transaction management using the common Spring transaction infrastructure (PlatformTransactionManager). Derives from the TransactionAspectSupport class which contains the integration with Spring's underlying transaction API. TransactionInterceptor simply calls the relevant superclass methods such as TransactionAspectSupport.invokeWithinTransaction(java.lang.reflect.Method, java.lang.Class<?>, org.springframework.transaction.interceptor.TransactionAspectSupport.InvocationCallback) in the correct order. TransactionInterceptors are thread-safe.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/interceptor/TransactionInterceptor.html
TransactionProxyFactoryBean	A										<section class="prog__container">Proxy factory bean for simplified declarative transaction handling. This is a convenient alternative to a standard AOP ProxyFactoryBean with a separate TransactionInterceptor definition. HISTORICAL NOTE: This class was originally designed to cover the typical case of declarative transaction demarcation: namely, wrapping a singleton target object with a transactional proxy, proxying all the interfaces that the target implements. However, in Spring versions 2.0 and beyond, the functionality provided here is superseded by the more convenient tx: XML namespace. See the declarative transaction management section of the Spring reference documentation to understand the modern options for managing transactions in Spring applications. For these reasons, users should favor of the tx: XML namespace as well as the @Transactional and @EnableTransactionManagement annotations.There are three main properties that need to be specified: "transactionManager": the PlatformTransactionManager implementation to use (for example, a JtaTransactionManager instance) "target": the target object that a transactional proxy should be created for "transactionAttributes": the transaction attributes (for example, propagation behavior and "readOnly" flag) per target method name (or method name pattern) If the "transactionManager" property is not set explicitly and this FactoryBean is running in a ListableBeanFactory, a single matching bean of type PlatformTransactionManager will be fetched from the BeanFactory. In contrast to TransactionInterceptor, the transaction attributes are specified as properties, with method names as keys and transaction attribute descriptors as values. Method names are always applied to the target class. Internally, a TransactionInterceptor instance is used, but the user of this class does not have to care. Optionally, a method pointcut can be specified to cause conditional invocation of the underlying TransactionInterceptor. The "preInterceptors" and "postInterceptors" properties can be set to add additional interceptors to the mix, like PerformanceMonitorInterceptor. HINT: This class is often used with parent / child bean definitions. Typically, you will define the transaction manager and default transaction attributes (for method name patterns) in an abstract parent bean definition, deriving concrete child bean definitions for specific target objects. This reduces the per-bean definition effort to a minimum.  <bean id="baseTransactionProxy" class="org.springframework.transaction.interceptor.TransactionProxyFactoryBean"     abstract="true">   <property name="transactionManager" ref="transactionManager"/>   <property name="transactionAttributes">     <props>       <prop key="insert*">PROPAGATION_REQUIRED</prop>       <prop key="update*">PROPAGATION_REQUIRED</prop>       <prop key="*">PROPAGATION_REQUIRED,readOnly</prop>     </props>   </property> </bean> <bean id="myProxy" parent="baseTransactionProxy">   <property name="target" ref="myTarget"/> </bean> <bean id="yourProxy" parent="baseTransactionProxy">   <property name="target" ref="yourTarget"/> </bean></section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/interceptor/TransactionProxyFactoryBean.html
JtaAfterCompletionSynchronization	A										<section class="prog__container">Adapter for a JTA Synchronization, invoking the afterCommit / afterCompletion callbacks of Spring TransactionSynchronization objects callbacks after the outer JTA transaction has completed. Applied when participating in an existing (non-Spring) JTA transaction.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/jta/JtaAfterCompletionSynchronization.html
JtaTransactionManager	A										<section class="prog__container">PlatformTransactionManager implementation for JTA, delegating to a backend JTA provider. This is typically used to delegate to a Java EE server's transaction coordinator, but may also be configured with a local JTA provider which is embedded within the application. This transaction manager is appropriate for handling distributed transactions, i.e. transactions that span multiple resources, and for controlling transactions on application server resources (e.g. JDBC DataSources available in JNDI) in general. For a single JDBC DataSource, DataSourceTransactionManager is perfectly sufficient, and for accessing a single resource with Hibernate (including transactional cache), HibernateTransactionManager is appropriate, for example. For typical JTA transactions (REQUIRED, SUPPORTS, MANDATORY, NEVER), a plain JtaTransactionManager definition is all you need, portable across all Java EE servers. This corresponds to the functionality of the JTA UserTransaction, for which Java EE specifies a standard JNDI name ("java:comp/UserTransaction"). There is no need to configure a server-specific TransactionManager lookup for this kind of JTA usage. Transaction suspension (REQUIRES_NEW, NOT_SUPPORTED) is just available with a JTA TransactionManager being registered. Common TransactionManager locations are autodetected by JtaTransactionManager, provided that the "autodetectTransactionManager" flag is set to "true" (which it is by default). Note: Support for the JTA TransactionManager interface is not required by Java EE. Almost all Java EE servers expose it, but do so as extension to EE. There might be some issues with compatibility, despite the TransactionManager interface being part of JTA. As a consequence, Spring provides various vendor-specific PlatformTransactionManagers, which are recommended to be used if appropriate: WebLogicJtaTransactionManager and WebSphereUowTransactionManager. For all other Java EE servers, the standard JtaTransactionManager is sufficient. This pure JtaTransactionManager class supports timeouts but not per-transaction isolation levels. Custom subclasses may override the doJtaBegin(org.springframework.transaction.jta.JtaTransactionObject, org.springframework.transaction.TransactionDefinition) method for specific JTA extensions in order to provide this functionality; Spring includes a corresponding WebLogicJtaTransactionManager class for WebLogic Server. Such adapters for specific Java EE transaction coordinators may also expose transaction names for monitoring; with standard JTA, transaction names will simply be ignored. Consider using Spring's tx:jta-transaction-manager configuration element for automatically picking the appropriate JTA platform transaction manager (automatically detecting WebLogic and WebSphere).JTA 1.1 adds the TransactionSynchronizationRegistry facility, as public Java EE 5 API in addition to the standard JTA UserTransaction handle. As of Spring 2.5, this JtaTransactionManager autodetects the TransactionSynchronizationRegistry and uses it for registering Spring-managed synchronizations when participating in an existing JTA transaction (e.g. controlled by EJB CMT). If no TransactionSynchronizationRegistry is available, then such synchronizations will be registered via the (non-EE) JTA TransactionManager handle. This class is serializable. However, active synchronizations do not survive serialization.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/jta/JtaTransactionManager.html
JtaTransactionObject	A										<section class="prog__container">JTA transaction object, representing a UserTransaction. Used as transaction object by Spring's JtaTransactionManager. Note: This is an SPI class, not intended to be used by applications.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/jta/JtaTransactionObject.html
ManagedTransactionAdapter	A										<section class="prog__container">Adapter for a managed JTA Transaction handle, taking a JTA TransactionManager reference and creating a JTA Transaction handle for it.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/jta/ManagedTransactionAdapter.html
SimpleTransactionFactory	A										<section class="prog__container">Default implementation of the TransactionFactory strategy interface, simply wrapping a standard JTA TransactionManager. Does not support transaction names; simply ignores any specified name.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/jta/SimpleTransactionFactory.html
SpringJtaSynchronizationAdapter	A										<section class="prog__container">Adapter that implements the JTA Synchronization interface delegating to an underlying Spring TransactionSynchronization. Useful for synchronizing Spring resource management code with plain JTA / EJB CMT transactions, despite the original code being built for Spring transaction synchronization.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/jta/SpringJtaSynchronizationAdapter.html
TransactionFactory	A										<section class="prog__container">Strategy interface for creating JTA Transaction objects based on specified transactional characteristics. The default implementation, SimpleTransactionFactory, simply wraps a standard JTA TransactionManager. This strategy interface allows for more sophisticated implementations that adapt to vendor-specific JTA extensions.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/jta/TransactionFactory.html
UserTransactionAdapter	A										<section class="prog__container">Adapter for a JTA UserTransaction handle, taking a JTA TransactionManager reference and creating a JTA UserTransaction handle for it. The JTA UserTransaction interface is an exact subset of the JTA TransactionManager interface. Unfortunately, it does not serve as super-interface of TransactionManager, though, which requires an adapter such as this class to be used when intending to talk to a TransactionManager handle through the UserTransaction interface. Used internally by Spring's JtaTransactionManager for certain scenarios. Not intended for direct use in application code.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/jta/UserTransactionAdapter.html
WebLogicJtaTransactionManager	A										<section class="prog__container">Special JtaTransactionManager variant for BEA WebLogic (9.0 and higher). Supports the full power of Spring's transaction definitions on WebLogic's transaction coordinator, beyond standard JTA: transaction names, per-transaction isolation levels, and proper resuming of transactions in all cases. Uses WebLogic's special begin(name) method to start a JTA transaction, in order to make Spring-driven transactions visible in WebLogic's transaction monitor. In case of Spring's declarative transactions, the exposed name will (by default) be the fully-qualified class name + "." + method name. Supports a per-transaction isolation level through WebLogic's corresponding JTA transaction property "ISOLATION LEVEL". This will apply the specified isolation level (e.g. ISOLATION_SERIALIZABLE) to all JDBC Connections that participate in the given transaction. Invokes WebLogic's special forceResume method if standard JTA resume failed, to also resume if the target transaction was marked rollback-only. If you're not relying on this feature of transaction suspension in the first place, Spring's standard JtaTransactionManager will behave properly too. By default, the JTA UserTransaction and TransactionManager handles are fetched directly from WebLogic's TransactionHelper. This can be overridden by specifying "userTransaction"/"userTransactionName" and "transactionManager"/"transactionManagerName", passing in existing handles or specifying corresponding JNDI locations to look up. NOTE: This JtaTransactionManager is intended to refine specific transaction demarcation behavior on Spring's side. It will happily co-exist with independently configured WebLogic transaction strategies in your persistence provider, with no need to specifically connect those setups in any way.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/jta/WebLogicJtaTransactionManager.html
WebSphereUowTransactionManager	A										<section class="prog__container">WebSphere-specific PlatformTransactionManager implementation that delegates to a UOWManager instance, obtained from WebSphere's JNDI environment. This allows Spring to leverage the full power of the WebSphere transaction coordinator, including transaction suspension, in a manner that is perfectly compliant with officially supported WebSphere API. The CallbackPreferringPlatformTransactionManager interface implemented by this class indicates that callers should preferably pass in a TransactionCallback through the execute(org.springframework.transaction.TransactionDefinition, org.springframework.transaction.support.TransactionCallback<T>) method, which will be handled through the callback-based WebSphere UOWManager API instead of through standard JTA API (UserTransaction / TransactionManager). This avoids the use of the non-public javax.transaction.TransactionManager API on WebSphere, staying within supported WebSphere API boundaries. This transaction manager implementation derives from Spring's standard JtaTransactionManager, inheriting the capability to support programmatic transaction demarcation via getTransaction / commit / rollback calls through a JTA UserTransaction handle, for callers that do not use the TransactionCallback-based execute(org.springframework.transaction.TransactionDefinition, org.springframework.transaction.support.TransactionCallback<T>) method. However, transaction suspension is not supported in this getTransaction style (unless you explicitly specify a JtaTransactionManager.setTransactionManager(javax.transaction.TransactionManager) reference, despite the official WebSphere recommendations). Use the execute(org.springframework.transaction.TransactionDefinition, org.springframework.transaction.support.TransactionCallback<T>) style for any code that might require transaction suspension. This transaction manager is compatible with WebSphere 6.1.0.9 and above. The default JNDI location for the UOWManager is "java:comp/websphere/UOWManager". If the location happens to differ according to your WebSphere documentation, simply specify the actual location through this transaction manager's "uowManagerName" bean property. NOTE: This JtaTransactionManager is intended to refine specific transaction demarcation behavior on Spring's side. It will happily co-exist with independently configured WebSphere transaction strategies in your persistence provider, with no need to specifically connect those setups in any way.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/jta/WebSphereUowTransactionManager.html
AbstractPlatformTransactionManager	A										<section class="prog__container">Abstract base class that implements Spring's standard transaction workflow, serving as basis for concrete platform transaction managers like JtaTransactionManager. This base class provides the following workflow handling: determines if there is an existing transaction; applies the appropriate propagation behavior; suspends and resumes transactions if necessary; checks the rollback-only flag on commit; applies the appropriate modification on rollback (actual rollback or setting rollback-only); triggers registered synchronization callbacks (if transaction synchronization is active). Subclasses have to implement specific template methods for specific states of a transaction, e.g.: begin, suspend, resume, commit, rollback. The most important of them are abstract and must be provided by a concrete implementation; for the rest, defaults are provided, so overriding is optional. Transaction synchronization is a generic mechanism for registering callbacks that get invoked at transaction completion time. This is mainly used internally by the data access support classes for JDBC, Hibernate, JPA, etc when running within a JTA transaction: They register resources that are opened within the transaction for closing at transaction completion time, allowing e.g. for reuse of the same Hibernate Session within the transaction. The same mechanism can also be leveraged for custom synchronization needs in an application. The state of this class is serializable, to allow for serializing the transaction strategy along with proxies that carry a transaction interceptor. It is up to subclasses if they wish to make their state to be serializable too. They should implement the java.io.Serializable marker interface in that case, and potentially a private readObject() method (according to Java serialization rules) if they need to restore any transient state.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/support/AbstractPlatformTransactionManager.html
AbstractPlatformTransactionManager.SuspendedResourcesHolder	A										<section class="prog__container">Holder for suspended resources. Used internally by suspend and resume.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/support/AbstractPlatformTransactionManager.SuspendedResourcesHolder.html
AbstractTransactionStatus	A										<section class="prog__container">Abstract base implementation of the TransactionStatus interface. Pre-implements the handling of local rollback-only and completed flags, and delegation to an underlying SavepointManager. Also offers the option of a holding a savepoint within the transaction. Does not assume any specific internal transaction handling, such as an underlying transaction object, and no transaction synchronization mechanism.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/support/AbstractTransactionStatus.html
CallbackPreferringPlatformTransactionManager	A										<section class="prog__container">Extension of the PlatformTransactionManager interface, exposing a method for executing a given callback within a transaction. Implementors of this interface automatically express a preference for callbacks over programmatic getTransaction, commit and rollback calls. Calling code may check whether a given transaction manager implements this interface to choose to prepare a callback instead of explicit transaction demarcation control. Spring's TransactionTemplate and TransactionInterceptor detect and use this PlatformTransactionManager variant automatically.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/support/CallbackPreferringPlatformTransactionManager.html
DefaultTransactionDefinition	A										<section class="prog__container">Default implementation of the TransactionDefinition interface, offering bean-style configuration and sensible default values (PROPAGATION_REQUIRED, ISOLATION_DEFAULT, TIMEOUT_DEFAULT, readOnly=false). Base class for both TransactionTemplate and DefaultTransactionAttribute.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/support/DefaultTransactionDefinition.html
DefaultTransactionStatus	A										<section class="prog__container">Default implementation of the TransactionStatus interface, used by AbstractPlatformTransactionManager. Based on the concept of an underlying "transaction object". Holds all status information that AbstractPlatformTransactionManager needs internally, including a generic transaction object determined by the concrete transaction manager implementation. Supports delegating savepoint-related methods to a transaction object that implements the SavepointManager interface. NOTE: This is not intended for use with other PlatformTransactionManager implementations, in particular not for mock transaction managers in testing environments. Use the alternative SimpleTransactionStatus class or a mock for the plain TransactionStatus interface instead.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/support/DefaultTransactionStatus.html
DelegatingTransactionDefinition	A										<section class="prog__container">TransactionDefinition implementation that delegates all calls to a given target TransactionDefinition instance. Abstract because it is meant to be subclassed, with subclasses overriding specific methods that are not supposed to simply delegate to the target instance.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/support/DelegatingTransactionDefinition.html
ResourceHolder	A										<section class="prog__container">Generic interface to be implemented by resource holders. Allows Spring's transaction infrastructure to introspect and reset the holder when necessary.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/support/ResourceHolder.html
ResourceHolderSupport	A										<section class="prog__container">Convenient base class for resource holders. Features rollback-only support for nested transactions. Can expire after a certain number of seconds or milliseconds, to determine transactional timeouts.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/support/ResourceHolderSupport.html
ResourceTransactionManager	A										<section class="prog__container">Extension of the PlatformTransactionManager interface, indicating a native resource transaction manager, operating on a single target resource. Such transaction managers differ from JTA transaction managers in that they do not use XA transaction enlistment for an open number of resources but rather focus on leveraging the native power and simplicity of a single target resource. This interface is mainly used for abstract introspection of a transaction manager, giving clients a hint on what kind of transaction manager they have been given and on what concrete resource the transaction manager is operating on.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/support/ResourceTransactionManager.html
SimpleTransactionScope	A										<section class="prog__container">A simple transaction-backed Scope implementation, delegating to TransactionSynchronizationManager's resource binding mechanism. NOTE: Like SimpleThreadScope, this transaction scope is not registered by default in common contexts. Instead, you need to explicitly assign it to a scope key in your setup, either through ConfigurableBeanFactory.registerScope(java.lang.String, org.springframework.beans.factory.config.Scope) or through a CustomScopeConfigurer bean.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/support/SimpleTransactionScope.html
SimpleTransactionStatus	A										<section class="prog__container">A simple TransactionStatus implementation. Derives from AbstractTransactionStatus and adds an explicit "newTransaction" flag. This class is not used by any of Spring's pre-built PlatformTransactionManager implementations. It is mainly provided as a start for custom transaction manager implementations and as a static mock for testing transactional code (either as part of a mock PlatformTransactionManager or as argument passed into a TransactionCallback to be tested).</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/support/SimpleTransactionStatus.html
SmartTransactionObject	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface to be implemented by transaction objects that are able to return an internal rollback-only marker, typically from a another transaction that has participated and marked it as rollback-only. Autodetected by DefaultTransactionStatus, to always return a current rollbackOnly flag even if not resulting from the current TransactionStatus.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/support/SmartTransactionObject.html
TransactionCallback	A										<section class="prog__container">Callback interface for transactional code. Used with TransactionTemplate's execute method, often as anonymous class within a method implementation. Typically used to assemble various calls to transaction-unaware data access services into a higher-level service method with transaction demarcation. As an alternative, consider the use of declarative transaction demarcation (e.g. through Spring's Transactional annotation).</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/support/TransactionCallback.html
TransactionCallbackWithoutResult	A										<section class="prog__container">Simple convenience class for TransactionCallback implementation. Allows for implementing a doInTransaction version without result, i.e. without the need for a return statement.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/support/TransactionCallbackWithoutResult.html
TransactionOperations	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface specifying basic transaction execution operations. Implemented by TransactionTemplate. Not often used directly, but a useful option to enhance testability, as it can easily be mocked or stubbed.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/support/TransactionOperations.html
TransactionSynchronization	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface for transaction synchronization callbacks. Supported by AbstractPlatformTransactionManager. TransactionSynchronization implementations can implement the Ordered interface to influence their execution order. A synchronization that does not implement the Ordered interface is appended to the end of the synchronization chain. System synchronizations performed by Spring itself use specific order values, allowing for fine-grained interaction with their execution order (if necessary).</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/support/TransactionSynchronization.html
TransactionSynchronizationAdapter	A										<section class="prog__container">Simple TransactionSynchronization adapter containing empty method implementations, for easier overriding of single methods. Also implements the Ordered interface to enable the execution order of synchronizations to be controlled declaratively. The default order is Ordered.LOWEST_PRECEDENCE, indicating late execution; return a lower value for earlier execution.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/support/TransactionSynchronizationAdapter.html
TransactionSynchronizationManager	A										<section class="prog__container">Central delegate that manages resources and transaction synchronizations per thread. To be used by resource management code but not by typical application code. Supports one resource per key without overwriting, that is, a resource needs to be removed before a new one can be set for the same key. Supports a list of transaction synchronizations if synchronization is active. Resource management code should check for thread-bound resources, e.g. JDBC Connections or Hibernate Sessions, via getResource. Such code is normally not supposed to bind resources to threads, as this is the responsibility of transaction managers. A further option is to lazily bind on first use if transaction synchronization is active, for performing transactions that span an arbitrary number of resources. Transaction synchronization must be activated and deactivated by a transaction manager via initSynchronization() and clearSynchronization(). This is automatically supported by AbstractPlatformTransactionManager, and thus by all standard Spring transaction managers, such as JtaTransactionManager and DataSourceTransactionManager. Resource management code should only register synchronizations when this manager is active, which can be checked via isSynchronizationActive(); it should perform immediate resource cleanup else. If transaction synchronization isn't active, there is either no current transaction, or the transaction manager doesn't support transaction synchronization. Synchronization is for example used to always return the same resources within a JTA transaction, e.g. a JDBC Connection or a Hibernate Session for any given DataSource or SessionFactory, respectively.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/support/TransactionSynchronizationManager.html
TransactionSynchronizationUtils	A										<section class="prog__container">Utility methods for triggering specific TransactionSynchronization callback methods on all currently registered synchronizations.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/support/TransactionSynchronizationUtils.html
TransactionTemplate	A										<section class="prog__container">Template class that simplifies programmatic transaction demarcation and transaction exception handling. The central method is execute(org.springframework.transaction.support.TransactionCallback<T>), supporting transactional code that implements the TransactionCallback interface. This template handles the transaction lifecycle and possible exceptions such that neither the TransactionCallback implementation nor the calling code needs to explicitly handle transactions. Typical usage: Allows for writing low-level data access objects that use resources such as JDBC DataSources but are not transaction-aware themselves. Instead, they can implicitly participate in transactions handled by higher-level application services utilizing this class, making calls to the low-level services via an inner-class callback object. Can be used within a service implementation via direct instantiation with a transaction manager reference, or get prepared in an application context and passed to services as bean reference. Note: The transaction manager should always be configured as bean in the application context: in the first case given to the service directly, in the second case given to the prepared template. Supports setting the propagation behavior and the isolation level by name, for convenient configuration in context definitions.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/support/TransactionTemplate.html
ExtendedModelMap	A										<section class="prog__container">Subclass of ModelMap that implements the Model interface. Java 5 specific like the Model interface itself. This is an implementation class exposed to handler methods by Spring MVC, typically via a declaration of the Model interface. There is no need to build it within user code; a plain ModelMap or even a just a regular Map with String keys will be good enough to return a user model.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/ui/ExtendedModelMap.html
Model	A										<section class="prog__container">Java-5-specific interface that defines a holder for model attributes. Primarily designed for adding attributes to the model. Allows for accessing the overall model as a java.util.Map.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/ui/Model.html
ModelMap	A										<section class="prog__container">Implementation of Map for use when building model data for use with UI tools. Supports chained calls and generation of model attribute names. This class serves as generic model holder for both Servlet and Portlet MVC, but is not tied to either of those. Check out the Model interface for a Java-5-based interface variant that serves the same purpose.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/ui/ModelMap.html
HierarchicalThemeSource	A										<section class="prog__container">Sub-interface of ThemeSource to be implemented by objects that can resolve theme messages hierarchically.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/ui/context/HierarchicalThemeSource.html
Theme	A										<section class="prog__container">A Theme can resolve theme-specific messages, codes, file paths, etcetera (e.g. CSS and image files in a web environment). The exposed MessageSource supports theme-specific parameterization and internationalization.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/ui/context/Theme.html
ThemeSource	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface to be implemented by objects that can resolve Themes. This enables parameterization and internationalization of messages for a given 'theme'.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/ui/context/ThemeSource.html
DelegatingThemeSource	A										<section class="prog__container">Empty ThemeSource that delegates all calls to the parent ThemeSource. If no parent is available, it simply won't resolve any theme. Used as placeholder by UiApplicationContextUtils, if a context doesn't define its own ThemeSource. Not intended for direct use in applications.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/ui/context/support/DelegatingThemeSource.html
ResourceBundleThemeSource	A										<section class="prog__container">ThemeSource implementation that looks up an individual ResourceBundle per theme. The theme name gets interpreted as ResourceBundle basename, supporting a common basename prefix for all themes.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/ui/context/support/ResourceBundleThemeSource.html
SimpleTheme	A										<section class="prog__container">Default Theme implementation, wrapping a name and an underlying MessageSource.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/ui/context/support/SimpleTheme.html
UiApplicationContextUtils	A										<section class="prog__container">Utility class for UI application context implementations. Provides support for a special bean named "themeSource", of type ThemeSource.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/ui/context/support/UiApplicationContextUtils.html
FreeMarkerConfigurationFactory	A										<section class="prog__container">Factory that configures a FreeMarker Configuration. Can be used standalone, but typically you will either use FreeMarkerConfigurationFactoryBean for preparing a Configuration as bean reference, or FreeMarkerConfigurer for web views. The optional "configLocation" property sets the location of a FreeMarker properties file, within the current application. FreeMarker properties can be overridden via "freemarkerSettings". All of these properties will be set by calling FreeMarker's Configuration.setSettings() method and are subject to constraints set by FreeMarker. The "freemarkerVariables" property can be used to specify a Map of shared variables that will be applied to the Configuration via the setAllSharedVariables() method. Like setSettings(), these entries are subject to FreeMarker constraints. The simplest way to use this class is to specify a "templateLoaderPath"; FreeMarker does not need any further configuration then. Note: Spring's FreeMarker support requires FreeMarker 2.3 or higher.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/ui/freemarker/FreeMarkerConfigurationFactory.html
FreeMarkerConfigurationFactoryBean	A										<section class="prog__container">Factory bean that creates a FreeMarker Configuration and provides it as bean reference. This bean is intended for any kind of usage of FreeMarker in application code, e.g. for generating email content. For web views, FreeMarkerConfigurer is used to set up a FreeMarkerConfigurationFactory. The simplest way to use this class is to specify just a "templateLoaderPath"; you do not need any further configuration then. For example, in a web application context:  <bean id="freemarkerConfiguration" class="org.springframework.ui.freemarker.FreeMarkerConfigurationFactoryBean">   <property name="templateLoaderPath" value="/WEB-INF/freemarker/"/> </bean> See the base class FreeMarkerConfigurationFactory for configuration details. Note: Spring's FreeMarker support requires FreeMarker 2.3 or higher.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/ui/freemarker/FreeMarkerConfigurationFactoryBean.html

JasperReportsUtils	A										<section class="prog__container">Utility methods for working with JasperReports. Provides a set of convenience methods for generating reports in a CSV, HTML, PDF and XLS formats. This class is compatible with classic JasperReports releases back until 2.x. As a consequence, it keeps using the JRExporter API which has been deprecated in early 2014.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/ui/jasperreports/JasperReportsUtils.html
SpringResourceLoader	A										<section class="prog__container">Velocity ResourceLoader adapter that loads via a Spring ResourceLoader. Used by VelocityEngineFactory for any resource loader path that cannot be resolved to a java.io.File. Note that this loader does not allow for modification detection: Use Velocity's default FileResourceLoader for java.io.File resources. Expects "spring.resource.loader" and "spring.resource.loader.path" application attributes in the Velocity runtime: the former of type org.springframework.core.io.ResourceLoader, the latter a String.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/ui/velocity/SpringResourceLoader.html
VelocityEngineFactory	A										<section class="prog__container">Deprecated. as of Spring 4.3, in favor of FreeMarker</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/ui/velocity/VelocityEngineFactory.html
VelocityEngineFactoryBean	A										<section class="prog__container">Deprecated. as of Spring 4.3, in favor of FreeMarker</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/ui/velocity/VelocityEngineFactoryBean.html

AlternativeJdkIdGenerator	A										<section class="prog__container">An IdGenerator that uses SecureRandom for the initial seed and Random thereafter, instead of calling UUID.randomUUID() every time as JdkIdGenerator does. This provides a better balance between securely random ids and performance.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/util/AlternativeJdkIdGenerator.html
AntPathMatcher.AntPathStringMatcher	A										<section class="prog__container">Tests whether or not a string matches against a pattern via a Pattern. The pattern may contain special characters: '*' means zero or more characters; '?' means one and only one character; '{' and '}' indicate a URI template pattern. For example /users/{user}.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/util/AntPathMatcher.AntPathStringMatcher.html
AntPathMatcher.AntPatternComparator	A										<section class="prog__container">The default Comparator implementation returned by AntPathMatcher.getPatternComparator(String). In order, the most "generic" pattern is determined by the following: if it's null or a capture all pattern (i.e. it is equal to "/**")if the other pattern is an actual matchif it's a catch-all pattern (i.e. it ends with "**"if it's got more "*" than the other patternif it's got more "{foo}" than the other patternif it's shorter than the other pattern</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/util/AntPathMatcher.AntPatternComparator.html
AntPathMatcher	A										<section class="prog__container">PathMatcher implementation for Ant-style path patterns. Part of this mapping code has been kindly borrowed from Apache Ant. The mapping matches URLs using the following rules:? matches one character* matches zero or more characters** matches zero or more directories in a path{spring:[a-z]+} matches the regexp [a-z]+ as a path variable named "spring"Examplescom/t?st.jsp — matches com/test.jsp but also com/tast.jsp or com/txst.jspcom/*.jsp — matches all .jsp files in the com directorycom/**/test.jsp — matches all test.jsp files underneath the com pathorg/springframework/**/*.jsp — matches all .jsp files underneath the org/springframework pathorg/**/servlet/bla.jsp — matches org/springframework/servlet/bla.jsp but also org/springframework/testing/servlet/bla.jsp and org/servlet/bla.jspcom/{filename:\\w+}.jsp will match com/test.jsp and assign the value test to the filename variableNote: a pattern and a path must both be absolute or must both be relative in order for the two to match. Therefore it is recommended that users of this implementation to sanitize patterns in order to prefix them with "/" as it makes sense in the context in which they're used.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/util/AntPathMatcher.html
Assert	A										<section class="prog__container">Assertion utility class that assists in validating arguments. Useful for identifying programmer errors early and clearly at runtime. For example, if the contract of a public method states it does not allow null arguments, Assert can be used to validate that contract. Doing this clearly indicates a contract violation when it occurs and protects the class's invariants. Typically used to validate method arguments rather than configuration properties, to check for cases that are usually programmer errors rather than configuration errors. In contrast to configuration initialization code, there is usually no point in falling back to defaults in such methods. This class is similar to JUnit's assertion library. If an argument value is deemed invalid, an IllegalArgumentException is thrown (typically). For example:  Assert.notNull(clazz, "The class must not be null"); Assert.isTrue(i > 0, "The value must be greater than zero");Mainly for internal use within the framework; consider Apache's Commons Lang for a more comprehensive suite of String utilities.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/util/Assert.html

AutoPopulatingList	A										<section class="prog__container">Simple List wrapper class that allows for elements to be automatically populated as they are requested. This is particularly useful for data binding to Lists, allowing for elements to be created and added to the List in a "just in time" fashion. Note: This class is not thread-safe. To create a thread-safe version, use the Collections.synchronizedList(java.util.List<T>) utility methods. Inspired by LazyList from Commons Collections.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/util/AutoPopulatingList.html
Base64Utils	A										<section class="prog__container">A simple utility class for Base64 encoding and decoding. Adapts to either Java 8's Base64 class or Apache Commons Codec's Base64 class. With neither Java 8 nor Commons Codec present, encode(byte[])/decode(byte[]) calls will throw an IllegalStateException. However, as of Spring 4.2, encodeToString(byte[]) and decodeFromString(java.lang.String) will nevertheless work since they can delegate to the JAXB DatatypeConverter as a fallback. However, this does not apply when using the "UrlSafe" methods for RFC 4648 "URL and Filename Safe Alphabet"; a delegate is required. Note: Apache Commons Codec does not add padding (=) when encoding with the URL and Filename Safe Alphabet.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/util/Base64Utils.html
ClassUtils	A										<section class="prog__container">Miscellaneous class utility methods. Mainly for internal use within the framework.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/util/ClassUtils.html

This implementation maintains a linked set of iterators which are invoked in sequence until all iterators are exhausted.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/util/CompositeIterator.html
ConcurrencyThrottleSupport	A										<section class="prog__container">Support class for throttling concurrent access to a specific resource. Designed for use as a base class, with the subclass invoking the beforeAccess() and afterAccess() methods at appropriate points of its workflow. Note that afterAccess should usually be called in a finally block! The default concurrency limit of this support class is -1 ("unbounded concurrency"). Subclasses may override this default; check the javadoc of the concrete class that you're using.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/util/ConcurrencyThrottleSupport.html

ConcurrentReferenceHashMap	A										<section class="prog__container">A ConcurrentHashMap that uses soft or weak references for both keys and values. This class can be used as an alternative to Collections.synchronizedMap(new WeakHashMap<K, Reference<V>>()) in order to support better performance when accessed concurrently. This implementation follows the same design constraints as ConcurrentHashMap with the exception that null values and null keys are supported. NOTE: The use of references means that there is no guarantee that items placed into the map will be subsequently available. The garbage collector may discard references at any time, so it may appear that an unknown thread is silently removing entries. If not explicitly specified, this implementation will use soft entry references.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/util/ConcurrentReferenceHashMap.html
ConcurrentReferenceHashMap.Reference	A										<section class="prog__container">A reference to an ConcurrentReferenceHashMap.Entry contained in the map. Implementations are usually wrappers around specific Java reference implementations (e.g., SoftReference).</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/util/ConcurrentReferenceHashMap.Reference.html

DefaultPropertiesPersister	A										<section class="prog__container">Default implementation of the PropertiesPersister interface. Follows the native parsing of java.util.Properties. Allows for reading from any Reader and writing to any Writer, for example to specify a charset for a properties file. This is a capability that standard java.util.Properties unfortunately lacked up until JDK 5: You were only able to load files using the ISO-8859-1 charset there. Loading from and storing to a stream delegates to Properties.load and Properties.store, respectively, to be fully compatible with the Unicode conversion as implemented by the JDK Properties class. As of JDK 6, Properties.load/store will also be used for readers/writers, effectively turning this class into a plain backwards compatibility adapter. The persistence code that works with Reader/Writer follows the JDK's parsing strategy but does not implement Unicode conversion, because the Reader/Writer should already apply proper decoding/encoding of characters. If you use prefer to escape unicode characters in your properties files, do not specify an encoding for a Reader/Writer (like ReloadableResourceBundleMessageSource's "defaultEncoding" and "fileEncodings" properties).</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/util/DefaultPropertiesPersister.html

In such cases, it may not be possible to throw the error to the original caller.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/util/ErrorHandler.html
ExceptionTypeFilter	A										<section class="prog__container">An InstanceFilter implementation that handles exception types. A type will match against a given candidate if it is assignable to that candidate.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/util/ExceptionTypeFilter.html
FastByteArrayOutputStream	A										<section class="prog__container">A speedy alternative to ByteArrayOutputStream. Note that this variant does not extend ByteArrayOutputStream, unlike its sibling ResizableByteArrayOutputStream. Unlike ByteArrayOutputStream, this implementation is backed by a LinkedList of byte[] instead of 1 constantly resizing byte[]. It does not copy buffers when it gets expanded. The initial buffer is only created when the stream is first written. There is also no copying of the internal buffer if its contents is extracted with the writeTo(OutputStream) method.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/util/FastByteArrayOutputStream.html
FileCopyUtils	A										<section class="prog__container">Simple utility methods for file and stream copying.

ResourceUtils	A										<section class="prog__container">Utility methods for resolving resource locations to files in the file system. Mainly for internal use within the framework. Consider using Spring's Resource abstraction in the core package for handling all kinds of file resources in a uniform manner. ResourceLoader's getResource() method can resolve any location to a Resource object, which in turn allows one to obtain a java.io.File in the file system through its getFile() method. The main reason for these utility methods for resource location handling is to support Log4jConfigurer, which must be able to resolve resource locations before the logging system has been initialized. Spring's Resource abstraction in the core package, on the other hand, already expects the logging system to be available.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/util/ResourceUtils.html

BindingErrorProcessor	A										<section class="prog__container">Strategy for processing DataBinder's missing field errors, and for translating a PropertyAccessException to a FieldError. The error processor is pluggable so you can treat errors differently if you want to. A default implementation is provided for typical needs. Note: As of Spring 2.0, this interface operates on a given BindingResult, to be compatible with any binding strategy (bean property, direct field access, etc). It can still receive a BindException as argument (since a BindException implements the BindingResult interface as well) but no longer operates on it directly.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/validation/BindingErrorProcessor.html
BindingResult	A										<section class="prog__container">General interface that represents binding results. Extends the interface for error registration capabilities, allowing for a Validator to be applied, and adds binding-specific analysis and model building.

BindingResultUtils	A										<section class="prog__container">Convenience methods for looking up BindingResults in a model Map.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/validation/BindingResultUtils.html
DataBinder	A										<section class="prog__container">Binder that allows for setting property values onto a target object, including support for validation and binding result analysis. The binding process can be customized through specifying allowed fields, required fields, custom editors, etc. Note that there are potential security implications in failing to set an array of allowed fields. In the case of HTTP form POST data for example, malicious clients can attempt to subvert an application by supplying values for fields or properties that do not exist on the form. In some cases this could lead to illegal data being set on command objects or their nested objects. For this reason, it is highly recommended to specify the allowedFields property on the DataBinder. The binding results can be examined via the BindingResult interface, extending the Errors interface: see the getBindingResult() method. Missing fields and property access exceptions will be converted to FieldErrors, collected in the Errors instance, using the following error codes: Missing field error: "required" Type mismatch error: "typeMismatch" Method invocation error: "methodInvocation" By default, binding errors get resolved through the BindingErrorProcessor strategy, processing for missing fields and property access exceptions: see the setBindingErrorProcessor(org.springframework.validation.BindingErrorProcessor) method. You can override the default strategy if needed, for example to generate different error codes. Custom validation errors can be added afterwards. You will typically want to resolve such error codes into proper user-visible error messages; this can be achieved through resolving each error via a MessageSource, which is able to resolve an ObjectError/FieldError through its MessageSource.getMessage(org.springframework.context.MessageSourceResolvable, java.util.Locale) method. The list of message codes can be customized through the MessageCodesResolver strategy: see the setMessageCodesResolver(org.springframework.validation.MessageCodesResolver) method. DefaultMessageCodesResolver's javadoc states details on the default resolution rules. This generic data binder can be used in any kind of environment. It is typically used by Spring web MVC controllers, via the web-specific subclasses ServletRequestDataBinder and PortletRequestDataBinder.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/validation/DataBinder.html
DefaultBindingErrorProcessor	A										<section class="prog__container">Default BindingErrorProcessor implementation. Uses the "required" error code and the field name to resolve message codes for a missing field error. Creates a FieldError for each PropertyAccessException given, using the PropertyAccessException's error code ("typeMismatch", "methodInvocation") for resolving message codes.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/validation/DefaultBindingErrorProcessor.html
DefaultMessageCodesResolver.Format	A										<section class="prog__container">Common message code formats.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/validation/DefaultMessageCodesResolver.Format.html
DefaultMessageCodesResolver	A										<section class="prog__container">Default implementation of the MessageCodesResolver interface. Will create two message codes for an object error, in the following order (when using the prefixedformatter): 1.: code + "." + object name 2.: code Will create four message codes for a field specification, in the following order: 1.: code + "." + object name + "." + field 2.: code + "." + field 3.: code + "." + field type 4.: code For example, in case of code "typeMismatch", object name "user", field "age": 1. try "typeMismatch.user.age" 2. try "typeMismatch.age" 3. try "typeMismatch.int" 4. try "typeMismatch" This resolution algorithm thus can be leveraged for example to show specific messages for binding errors like "required" and "typeMismatch": at the object + field level ("age" field, but only on "user"); at the field level (all "age" fields, no matter which object name); or at the general level (all fields, on any object). In case of array, List or Map properties, both codes for specific elements and for the whole collection are generated. Assuming a field "name" of an array "groups" in object "user": 1. try "typeMismatch.user.groups[0].name" 2. try "typeMismatch.user.groups.name" 3. try "typeMismatch.groups[0].name" 4. try "typeMismatch.groups.name" 5. try "typeMismatch.name" 6. try "typeMismatch.java.lang.String" 7. try "typeMismatch" By default the errorCodes will be placed at the beginning of constructed message strings. The messageCodeFormatter property can be used to specify an alternative concatenation format. In order to group all codes into a specific category within your resource bundles, e.g. "validation.typeMismatch.name" instead of the default "typeMismatch.name", consider specifying a prefix to be applied.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/validation/DefaultMessageCodesResolver.html
DirectFieldBindingResult	A										<section class="prog__container">Special implementation of the Errors and BindingResult interfaces, supporting registration and evaluation of binding errors on value objects. Performs direct field access instead of going through JavaBean getters. Since Spring 4.1 this implementation is able to traverse nested fields.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/validation/DirectFieldBindingResult.html
Errors	A										<section class="prog__container">Stores and exposes information about data-binding and validation errors for a specific object. Field names can be properties of the target object (e.g. "name" when binding to a customer object), or nested fields in case of subobjects (e.g. "address.street"). Supports subtree navigation via setNestedPath(String): for example, an AddressValidator validates "address", not being aware that this is a subobject of customer. Note: Errors objects are single-threaded.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/validation/Errors.html

ValidationUtils	A										<section class="prog__container">Utility class offering convenient methods for invoking a Validator and for rejecting empty fields. Checks for an empty field in Validator implementations can become one-liners when using rejectIfEmpty(org.springframework.validation.Errors, java.lang.String, java.lang.String) or rejectIfEmptyOrWhitespace(org.springframework.validation.Errors, java.lang.String, java.lang.String).</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/validation/ValidationUtils.html
Validator	A										<section class="prog__container">A validator for application-specific objects. This interface is totally divorced from any infrastructure or context; that is to say it is not coupled to validating only objects in the web tier, the data-access tier, or the whatever-tier. As such it is amenable to being used in any layer of an application, and supports the encapsulation of validation logic as a first-class citizen in its own right. Find below a simple but complete Validator implementation, which validates that the various String properties of a UserLogin instance are not empty (that is they are not null and do not consist wholly of whitespace), and that any password that is present is at least 'MINIMUM_PASSWORD_LENGTH' characters in length.  public class UserLoginValidator implements Validator {    private static final int MINIMUM_PASSWORD_LENGTH = 6;    public boolean supports(Class clazz) {       return UserLogin.class.isAssignableFrom(clazz);    }    public void validate(Object target, Errors errors) {       ValidationUtils.rejectIfEmptyOrWhitespace(errors, "userName", "field.required");       ValidationUtils.rejectIfEmptyOrWhitespace(errors, "password", "field.required");       UserLogin login = (UserLogin) target;       if (login.getPassword() != null             && login.getPassword().trim().length() < MINIMUM_PASSWORD_LENGTH) {          errors.rejectValue("password", "field.min.length",                new Object[]{Integer.valueOf(MINIMUM_PASSWORD_LENGTH)},                "The password must be at least [" + MINIMUM_PASSWORD_LENGTH + "] characters in length.");       }    } }See also the Spring reference manual for a fuller discussion of the Validator interface and it's role in an enterprise application.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/validation/Validator.html
Validated	A										<section class="prog__container">Variant of JSR-303's Valid, supporting the specification of validation groups. Designed for convenient use with Spring's JSR-303 support but not JSR-303 specific. Can be used e.g. with Spring MVC handler methods arguments. Supported through SmartValidator's validation hint concept, with validation group classes acting as hint objects. Can also be used with method level validation, indicating that a specific class is supposed to be validated at the method level (acting as a pointcut for the corresponding validation interceptor), but also optionally specifying the validation groups for method-level validation in the annotated class. Applying this annotation at the method level allows for overriding the validation groups for a specific method but does not serve as a pointcut; a class-level annotation is nevertheless necessary to trigger method validation for a specific bean to begin with. Can also be used as a meta-annotation on a custom stereotype annotation or a custom group-specific validated annotation.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/validation/annotation/Validated.html
BeanValidationPostProcessor	A										<section class="prog__container">Simple BeanPostProcessor that checks JSR-303 constraint annotations in Spring-managed beans, throwing an initialization exception in case of constraint violations right before calling the bean's init method (if any).</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/validation/beanvalidation/BeanValidationPostProcessor.html

Typically used to wrap the validation provider's default interpolator.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/validation/beanvalidation/LocaleContextMessageInterpolator.html
LocalValidatorFactoryBean	A										<section class="prog__container">This is the central class for javax.validation (JSR-303) setup in a Spring application context: It bootstraps a javax.validation.ValidationFactory and exposes it through the Spring Validator interface as well as through the JSR-303 Validator interface and the ValidatorFactory interface itself. When talking to an instance of this bean through the Spring or JSR-303 Validator interfaces, you'll be talking to the default Validator of the underlying ValidatorFactory. This is very convenient in that you don't have to perform yet another call on the factory, assuming that you will almost always use the default Validator anyway. This can also be injected directly into any target dependency of type Validator! As of Spring 4.0, this class supports Bean Validation 1.0 and 1.1, with special support for Hibernate Validator 4.3 and 5.x (see setValidationMessageSource(org.springframework.context.MessageSource)). Note that Bean Validation 1.1's #forExecutables method isn't supported: We do not expect that method to be called by application code; consider MethodValidationInterceptor instead. If you really need programmatic #forExecutables access, inject this class as a ValidatorFactory and call getValidator() on it, then #forExecutables on the returned native Validator reference instead of directly on this class. This class is also being used by Spring's MVC configuration namespace, in case of the javax.validation API being present but no explicit Validator having been configured.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/validation/beanvalidation/LocalValidatorFactoryBean.html

MethodValidationInterceptor	A										<section class="prog__container">An AOP Alliance MethodInterceptor implementation that delegates to a JSR-303 provider for performing method-level validation on annotated methods. Applicable methods have JSR-303 constraint annotations on their parameters and/or on their return value (in the latter case specified at the method level, typically as inline annotation). E.g.: public @NotNull Object myValidMethod(@NotNull String arg1, @Max(10) int arg2)Validation groups can be specified through Spring's Validated annotation at the type level of the containing target class, applying to all public service methods of that class. By default, JSR-303 will validate against its default group only. As of Spring 4.0, this functionality requires either a Bean Validation 1.1 provider (such as Hibernate Validator 5.x) or the Bean Validation 1.0 API with Hibernate Validator 4.3. The actual provider will be autodetected and automatically adapted.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/validation/beanvalidation/MethodValidationInterceptor.html
MethodValidationPostProcessor	A										<section class="prog__container">A convenient BeanPostProcessor implementation that delegates to a JSR-303 provider for performing method-level validation on annotated methods.

Validation groups can be specified through @Validated as well. By default, JSR-303 will validate against its default group only. As of Spring 4.0, this functionality requires either a Bean Validation 1.1 provider (such as Hibernate Validator 5.x) or the Bean Validation 1.0 API with Hibernate Validator 4.3. The actual provider will be autodetected and automatically adapted.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/validation/beanvalidation/MethodValidationPostProcessor.html
OptionalValidatorFactoryBean	A										<section class="prog__container">LocalValidatorFactoryBean subclass that simply turns Validator calls into no-ops in case of no Bean Validation provider being available. This is the actual class used by Spring's MVC configuration namespace, in case of the javax.validation API being present but no explicit Validator having been configured.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/validation/beanvalidation/OptionalValidatorFactoryBean.html
SpringConstraintValidatorFactory	A										<section class="prog__container">JSR-303 ConstraintValidatorFactory implementation that delegates to a Spring BeanFactory for creating autowired ConstraintValidator instances. Note that this class is meant for programmatic use, not for declarative use in a standard validation.xml file. Consider SpringWebConstraintValidatorFactory for declarative use in a web application, e.g. with JAX-RS or JAX-WS.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/validation/beanvalidation/SpringConstraintValidatorFactory.html
SpringValidatorAdapter	A										<section class="prog__container">Adapter that takes a JSR-303 javax.validator.Validator and exposes it as a Spring Validator while also exposing the original JSR-303 Validator interface itself.

BindingAwareModelMap	A										<section class="prog__container">Subclass of ExtendedModelMap that automatically removes a BindingResult object if the corresponding target attribute gets replaced through regular Map operations. This is the class exposed to handler methods by Spring MVC, typically consumed through a declaration of the Model interface. There is no need to build it within user code; a plain ModelMap or even a just a regular Map with String keys will be good enough to return a user model.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/validation/support/BindingAwareModelMap.html

HttpRequestHandler	A										<section class="prog__container">Plain handler interface for components that process HTTP requests, analogous to a Servlet. Only declares ServletException and IOException, to allow for usage within any HttpServlet. This interface is essentially the direct equivalent of an HttpServlet, reduced to a central handle method. The easiest way to expose an HttpRequestHandler bean in Spring style is to define it in Spring's root web application context and define an HttpRequestHandlerServlet in web.xml, pointing to the target HttpRequestHandler bean through its servlet-name which needs to match the target bean name. Supported as a handler type within Spring's DispatcherServlet, being able to interact with the dispatcher's advanced mapping and interception facilities. This is the recommended way of exposing an HttpRequestHandler, while keeping the handler implementations free of direct dependencies on a DispatcherServlet environment. Typically implemented to generate binary responses directly, with no separate view resource involved. This differentiates it from a Controller within Spring's Web MVC framework. The lack of a ModelAndView return value gives a clearer signature to callers other than the DispatcherServlet, indicating that there will never be a view to render. As of Spring 2.0, Spring's HTTP-based remote exporters, such as HttpInvokerServiceExporter and HessianServiceExporter, implement this interface rather than the more extensive Controller interface, for minimal dependencies on Spring-specific web infrastructure. Note that HttpRequestHandlers may optionally implement the LastModified interface, just like Controllers can, provided that they run within Spring's DispatcherServlet. However, this is usually not necessary, since HttpRequestHandlers typically only support POST requests to begin with. Alternatively, a handler may implement the "If-Modified-Since" HTTP header processing manually within its handle method.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/HttpRequestHandler.html

SpringServletContainerInitializer	A										<section class="prog__container">Servlet 3.0 ServletContainerInitializer designed to support code-based configuration of the servlet container using Spring's WebApplicationInitializer SPI as opposed to (or possibly in combination with) the traditional web.xml-based approach. Mechanism of Operation This class will be loaded and instantiated and have its onStartup(java.util.Set<java.lang.Class<?>>, javax.servlet.ServletContext) method invoked by any Servlet 3.0-compliant container during container startup assuming that the spring-web module JAR is present on the classpath. This occurs through the JAR Services API ServiceLoader.load(Class) method detecting the spring-web module's META-INF/services/javax.servlet.ServletContainerInitializer service provider configuration file. See the  JAR Services API documentation as well as section 8.2.4 of the Servlet 3.0 Final Draft specification for complete details. In combination with web.xml A web application can choose to limit the amount of classpath scanning the Servlet container does at startup either through the metadata-complete attribute in web.xml, which controls scanning for Servlet annotations or through an <absolute-ordering> element also in web.xml, which controls which web fragments (i.e. jars) are allowed to perform a ServletContainerInitializer scan. When using this feature, the SpringServletContainerInitializer can be enabled by adding "spring_web" to the list of named web fragments in web.xml as follows:  <absolute-ordering>   <name>some_web_fragment</name>   <name>spring_web</name> </absolute-ordering> Relationship to Spring's WebApplicationInitializer Spring's WebApplicationInitializer SPI consists of just one method: WebApplicationInitializer.onStartup(ServletContext). The signature is intentionally quite similar to ServletContainerInitializer.onStartup(Set, ServletContext): simply put, SpringServletContainerInitializer is responsible for instantiating and delegating the ServletContext to any user-defined WebApplicationInitializer implementations. It is then the responsibility of each WebApplicationInitializer to do the actual work of initializing the ServletContext. The exact process of delegation is described in detail in the onStartup documentation below. General Notes In general, this class should be viewed as supporting infrastructure for the more important and user-facing WebApplicationInitializer SPI. Taking advantage of this container initializer is also completely optional: while it is true that this initializer will be loaded and invoked under all Servlet 3.0+ runtimes, it remains the user's choice whether to make any WebApplicationInitializer implementations available on the classpath. If no WebApplicationInitializer types are detected, this container initializer will have no effect. Note that use of this container initializer and of WebApplicationInitializer is not in any way "tied" to Spring MVC other than the fact that the types are shipped in the spring-web module JAR. Rather, they can be considered general-purpose in their ability to facilitate convenient code-based configuration of the ServletContext. In other words, any servlet, listener, or filter may be registered within a WebApplicationInitializer, not just Spring MVC-specific components. This class is neither designed for extension nor intended to be extended. It should be considered an internal type, with WebApplicationInitializer being the public-facing SPI. See Also See WebApplicationInitializer Javadoc for examples and detailed usage recommendations.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/SpringServletContainerInitializer.html
WebApplicationInitializer	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface to be implemented in Servlet 3.0+ environments in order to configure the ServletContext programmatically -- as opposed to (or possibly in conjunction with) the traditional web.xml-based approach. Implementations of this SPI will be detected automatically by SpringServletContainerInitializer, which itself is bootstrapped automatically by any Servlet 3.0 container. See its Javadoc for details on this bootstrapping mechanism. ExampleThe traditional, XML-based approach Most Spring users building a web application will need to register Spring's DispatcherServlet. For reference, in WEB-INF/web.xml, this would typically be done as follows:  <servlet>   <servlet-name>dispatcher</servlet-name>   <servlet-class>     org.springframework.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet   </servlet-class>   <init-param>     <param-name>contextConfigLocation</param-name>     <param-value>/WEB-INF/spring/dispatcher-config.xml</param-value>   </init-param>   <load-on-startup>1</load-on-startup> </servlet> <servlet-mapping>   <servlet-name>dispatcher</servlet-name>   <url-pattern>/</url-pattern> </servlet-mapping>The code-based approach with WebApplicationInitializer Here is the equivalent DispatcherServlet registration logic, WebApplicationInitializer-style:  public class MyWebAppInitializer implements WebApplicationInitializer {    @Override    public void onStartup(ServletContext container) {      XmlWebApplicationContext appContext = new XmlWebApplicationContext();      appContext.setConfigLocation("/WEB-INF/spring/dispatcher-config.xml");      ServletRegistration.Dynamic dispatcher =        container.addServlet("dispatcher", new DispatcherServlet(appContext));      dispatcher.setLoadOnStartup(1);      dispatcher.addMapping("/");    } } As an alternative to the above, you can also extend from AbstractDispatcherServletInitializer. As you can see, thanks to Servlet 3.0's new ServletContext.addServlet(java.lang.String, java.lang.String) method we're actually registering an instance of the DispatcherServlet, and this means that the DispatcherServlet can now be treated like any other object -- receiving constructor injection of its application context in this case. This style is both simpler and more concise. There is no concern for dealing with init-params, etc, just normal JavaBean-style properties and constructor arguments. You are free to create and work with your Spring application contexts as necessary before injecting them into the DispatcherServlet. Most major Spring Web components have been updated to support this style of registration.  You'll find that DispatcherServlet, FrameworkServlet, ContextLoaderListener and DelegatingFilterProxy all now support constructor arguments. Even if a component (e.g. non-Spring, other third party) has not been specifically updated for use within WebApplicationInitializers, they still may be used in any case. The Servlet 3.0 ServletContext API allows for setting init-params, context-params, etc programmatically. A 100% code-based approach to configuration In the example above, WEB-INF/web.xml was successfully replaced with code in the form of a WebApplicationInitializer, but the actual dispatcher-config.xml Spring configuration remained XML-based. WebApplicationInitializer is a perfect fit for use with Spring's code-based @Configuration classes. See @Configuration Javadoc for complete details, but the following example demonstrates refactoring to use Spring's AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext in lieu of XmlWebApplicationContext, and user-defined @Configuration classes AppConfig and DispatcherConfig instead of Spring XML files. This example also goes a bit beyond those above to demonstrate typical configuration of the 'root' application context and registration of the ContextLoaderListener:  public class MyWebAppInitializer implements WebApplicationInitializer {    @Override    public void onStartup(ServletContext container) {      // Create the 'root' Spring application context      AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext rootContext =        new AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext();      rootContext.register(AppConfig.class);      // Manage the lifecycle of the root application context      container.addListener(new ContextLoaderListener(rootContext));      // Create the dispatcher servlet's Spring application context      AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext dispatcherContext =        new AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext();      dispatcherContext.register(DispatcherConfig.class);      // Register and map the dispatcher servlet      ServletRegistration.Dynamic dispatcher =        container.addServlet("dispatcher", new DispatcherServlet(dispatcherContext));      dispatcher.setLoadOnStartup(1);      dispatcher.addMapping("/");    } } As an alternative to the above, you can also extend from AbstractAnnotationConfigDispatcherServletInitializer. Remember that WebApplicationInitializer implementations are detected automatically -- so you are free to package them within your application as you see fit. Ordering WebApplicationInitializer executionWebApplicationInitializer implementations may optionally be annotated at the class level with Spring's @Order annotation or may implement Spring's Ordered interface. If so, the initializers will be ordered prior to invocation. This provides a mechanism for users to ensure the order in which servlet container initialization occurs. Use of this feature is expected to be rare, as typical applications will likely centralize all container initialization within a single WebApplicationInitializer. Caveatsweb.xml versioningWEB-INF/web.xml and WebApplicationInitializer use are not mutually exclusive; for example, web.xml can register one servlet, and a WebApplicationInitializer can register another. An initializer can even modify registrations performed in web.xml through methods such as ServletContext.getServletRegistration(String). However, if WEB-INF/web.xml is present in the application, its version attribute must be set to "3.0" or greater, otherwise ServletContainerInitializer bootstrapping will be ignored by the servlet container.Mapping to '/' under TomcatApache Tomcat maps its internal DefaultServlet to "/", and on Tomcat versions <= 7.0.14, this servlet mapping cannot be overridden programmatically. 7.0.15 fixes this issue. Overriding the "/" servlet mapping has also been tested successfully under GlassFish 3.1.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/WebApplicationInitializer.html
AbstractMappingContentNegotiationStrategy	A										<section class="prog__container">Base class for ContentNegotiationStrategy implementations with the steps to resolve a request to media types. First a key (e.g. "json", "pdf") must be extracted from the request (e.g. file extension, query param). The key must then be resolved to media type(s) through the base class MappingMediaTypeFileExtensionResolver which stores such mappings. The method handleNoMatch(org.springframework.web.context.request.NativeWebRequest, java.lang.String) allow sub-classes to plug in additional ways of looking up media types (e.g. through the Java Activation framework, or ServletContext.getMimeType(java.lang.String). Media types resolved via base classes are then added to the base class MappingMediaTypeFileExtensionResolver, i.e. cached for new lookups.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/accept/AbstractMappingContentNegotiationStrategy.html
ContentNegotiationManager	A										<section class="prog__container">Central class to determine requested media types for a request.

Setters may only turn individual strategies on or off. If you need a custom order for any reason simply instantiate ContentNegotiationManager directly. For the path extension and parameter strategies you may explicitly add MediaType mappings. This will be used to resolve path extensions or a parameter value such as "json" to a media type such as "application/json". The path extension strategy will also use ServletContext.getMimeType(java.lang.String) and the Java Activation framework (JAF), if available, to resolve a path extension to a MediaType. You may suppress the use of JAF.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/accept/ContentNegotiationManagerFactoryBean.html

Can also be used for manual data binding in custom web controllers: for example, in a plain Controller implementation or in a MultiActionController handler method. Simply instantiate a ServletRequestDataBinder for each binding process, and invoke bind with the current ServletRequest as argument:  MyBean myBean = new MyBean(); // apply binder to custom target object ServletRequestDataBinder binder = new ServletRequestDataBinder(myBean); // register custom editors, if desired binder.registerCustomEditor(...); // trigger actual binding of request parameters binder.bind(request); // optionally evaluate binding errors Errors errors = binder.getErrors(); ...</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/bind/ServletRequestDataBinder.html
ServletRequestParameterPropertyValues	A										<section class="prog__container">PropertyValues implementation created from parameters in a ServletRequest. Can look for all property values beginning with a certain prefix and prefix separator (default is "_"). For example, with a prefix of "spring", "spring_param1" and "spring_param2" result in a Map with "param1" and "param2" as keys.

WebDataBinder	A										<section class="prog__container">Special DataBinder for data binding from web request parameters to JavaBean objects. Designed for web environments, but not dependent on the Servlet API; serves as base class for more specific DataBinder variants, such as ServletRequestDataBinder. Includes support for field markers which address a common problem with HTML checkboxes and select options: detecting that a field was part of the form, but did not generate a request parameter because it was empty. A field marker allows to detect that state and reset the corresponding bean property accordingly. Default values, for parameters that are otherwise not present, can specify a value for the field other then empty.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/bind/WebDataBinder.html
ControllerAdvice	A										<section class="prog__container">Indicates the annotated class assists a "Controller". Serves as a specialization of @Component, allowing for implementation classes to be autodetected through classpath scanning. It is typically used to define @ExceptionHandler, @InitBinder, and @ModelAttribute methods that apply to all @RequestMapping methods. One of annotations(), basePackageClasses(), basePackages() or its alias value() may be specified to define specific subsets of Controllers to assist. When multiple selectors are applied, OR logic is applied - meaning selected Controllers should match at least one selector. The default behavior (i.e. if used without any selector), the @ControllerAdvice annotated class will assist all known Controllers. Note that those checks are done at runtime, so adding many attributes and using multiple strategies may have negative impacts (complexity, performance).</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/bind/annotation/ControllerAdvice.html
CookieValue	A										<section class="prog__container">Annotation which indicates that a method parameter should be bound to an HTTP cookie.

CrossOrigin	A										<section class="prog__container">Marks the annotated method or type as permitting cross origin requests. By default all origins and headers are permitted, credentials are allowed, and the maximum age is set to 1800 seconds (30 minutes). The list of HTTP methods is set to the methods on the @RequestMapping if not explicitly set on @CrossOrigin. NOTE: @CrossOrigin is processed if an appropriate HandlerMapping-HandlerAdapter pair is configured such as the RequestMappingHandlerMapping-RequestMappingHandlerAdapter pair which are the default in the MVC Java config and the MVC namespace. In particular @CrossOrigin is not supported with the DefaultAnnotationHandlerMapping-AnnotationMethodHandlerAdapter pair both of which are also deprecated.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/bind/annotation/CrossOrigin.html
DeleteMapping	A										<section class="prog__container">Annotation for mapping HTTP DELETE requests onto specific handler methods.

ExceptionHandler	A										<section class="prog__container">Annotation for handling exceptions in specific handler classes and/or handler methods. Provides consistent style between Servlet and Portlet environments, with the semantics adapting to the concrete environment. Handler methods which are annotated with this annotation are allowed to have very flexible signatures. They may have parameters of the following types, in arbitrary order: An exception argument: declared as a general Exception or as a more specific exception. This also serves as a mapping hint if the annotation itself does not narrow the exception types through its value(). Request and/or response objects (Servlet API or Portlet API). You may choose any specific request/response type, e.g. ServletRequest / HttpServletRequest or PortletRequest / ActionRequest / RenderRequest. Note that in the Portlet case, an explicitly declared action/render argument is also used for mapping specific request types onto a handler method (in case of no other information given that differentiates between action and render requests). Session object (Servlet API or Portlet API): either HttpSession or PortletSession. An argument of this type will enforce the presence of a corresponding session. As a consequence, such an argument will never be null. Note that session access may not be thread-safe, in particular in a Servlet environment: Consider switching the "synchronizeOnSession" flag to "true" if multiple requests are allowed to access a session concurrently.WebRequest or NativeWebRequest. Allows for generic request parameter access as well as request/session attribute access, without ties to the native Servlet/Portlet API. Locale for the current request locale (determined by the most specific locale resolver available, i.e. the configured LocaleResolver in a Servlet environment and the portal locale in a Portlet environment). InputStream / Reader for access to the request's content. This will be the raw InputStream/Reader as exposed by the Servlet/Portlet API. OutputStream / Writer for generating the response's content. This will be the raw OutputStream/Writer as exposed by the Servlet/Portlet API. Model as an alternative to returning a model map from the handler method. Note that the provided model is not pre-populated with regular model attributes and therefore always empty, as a convenience for preparing the model for an exception-specific view. The following return types are supported for handler methods: A ModelAndView object (Servlet MVC or Portlet MVC). A Model object, with the view name implicitly determined through a RequestToViewNameTranslator. A Map object for exposing a model, with the view name implicitly determined through a RequestToViewNameTranslator. A View object. A String value which is interpreted as view name. @ResponseBody annotated methods (Servlet-only) to set the response content. The return value will be converted to the response stream using message converters. An HttpEntity<?> or ResponseEntity<?> object (Servlet-only) to set response headers and content. The ResponseEntity body will be converted and written to the response stream using message converters. void if the method handles the response itself (by writing the response content directly, declaring an argument of type ServletResponse / HttpServletResponse / RenderResponse for that purpose) or if the view name is supposed to be implicitly determined through a RequestToViewNameTranslator (not declaring a response argument in the handler method signature; only applicable in a Servlet environment). In Servlet environments, you can combine the ExceptionHandler annotation with @ResponseStatus, to define the response status for the HTTP response. Note: In Portlet environments, ExceptionHandler annotated methods will only be called during the render and resource phases - just like HandlerExceptionResolver beans would. Exceptions carried over from the action and event phases will be invoked during the render phase as well, with exception handler methods having to be present on the controller class that defines the applicable render method.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/bind/annotation/ExceptionHandler.html
GetMapping	A										<section class="prog__container">Annotation for mapping HTTP GET requests onto specific handler methods.

Difference between @GetMapping & @RequestMapping@GetMapping does not support the consumes attribute of @RequestMapping.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/bind/annotation/GetMapping.html
InitBinder	A										<section class="prog__container">Annotation that identifies methods which initialize the WebDataBinder which will be used for populating command and form object arguments of annotated handler methods. Such init-binder methods support all arguments that RequestMapping supports, except for command/form objects and corresponding validation result objects. Init-binder methods must not have a return value; they are usually declared as void. Typical arguments are WebDataBinder in combination with WebRequest or Locale, allowing to register context-specific editors.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/bind/annotation/InitBinder.html
Mapping	A										<section class="prog__container">Meta annotation that indicates a web mapping annotation.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/bind/annotation/Mapping.html
MatrixVariable	A										<section class="prog__container">Annotation which indicates that a method parameter should be bound to a name-value pair within a path segment. Supported for RequestMapping annotated handler methods in Servlet environments. If the method parameter type is Map and a matrix variable name is specified, then the matrix variable value is converted to a Map assuming an appropriate conversion strategy is available. If the method parameter is Map<String, String> or MultiValueMap<String, String> and a variable name is not specified, then the map is populated with all matrix variable names and values.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/bind/annotation/MatrixVariable.html
ModelAttribute	A										<section class="prog__container">Annotation that binds a method parameter or method return value to a named model attribute, exposed to a web view. Supported for controller classes with @RequestMapping methods. Can be used to expose command objects to a web view, using specific attribute names, through annotating corresponding parameters of an @RequestMapping method. Can also be used to expose reference data to a web view through annotating accessor methods in a controller class with @RequestMapping methods. Such accessor methods are allowed to have any arguments that @RequestMapping methods support, returning the model attribute value to expose. Note however that reference data and all other model content is not available to web views when request processing results in an Exception since the exception could be raised at any time making the content of the model unreliable. For this reason @ExceptionHandler methods do not provide access to a Model argument.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/bind/annotation/ModelAttribute.html
PatchMapping	A										<section class="prog__container">Annotation for mapping HTTP PATCH requests onto specific handler methods.

RequestBody	A										<section class="prog__container">Annotation indicating a method parameter should be bound to the body of the web request. The body of the request is passed through an HttpMessageConverter to resolve the method argument depending on the content type of the request. Optionally, automatic validation can be applied by annotating the argument with @Valid. Supported for annotated handler methods in Servlet environments.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/bind/annotation/RequestBody.html
RequestHeader	A										<section class="prog__container">Annotation which indicates that a method parameter should be bound to a web request header.

RequestMapping	A										<section class="prog__container">Annotation for mapping web requests onto specific handler classes and/or handler methods. Provides a consistent style between Servlet and Portlet environments, with the semantics adapting to the concrete environment. NOTE: The set of features supported for Servlets is a superset of the set of features supported for Portlets. The places where this applies are marked with the label "Servlet-only" in this source file. For Servlet environments there are some further distinctions depending on whether an application is configured with "@MVC 3.0" or "@MVC 3.1" support classes. The places where this applies are marked with "@MVC 3.1-only" in this source file. For more details see the note on the new support classes added in Spring MVC 3.1 further below. Handler methods which are annotated with this annotation are allowed to have very flexible signatures. They may have parameters of the following types, in arbitrary order (except for validation results, which need to follow right after the corresponding command object, if desired): Request and/or response objects (Servlet API or Portlet API). You may choose any specific request/response type, e.g. ServletRequest / HttpServletRequest or PortletRequest / ActionRequest / RenderRequest. Note that in the Portlet case, an explicitly declared action/render argument is also used for mapping specific request types onto a handler method (in case of no other information given that differentiates between action and render requests). Session object (Servlet API or Portlet API): either HttpSession or PortletSession. An argument of this type will enforce the presence of a corresponding session. As a consequence, such an argument will never be null. Note that session access may not be thread-safe, in particular in a Servlet environment: Consider switching the "synchronizeOnSession" flag to "true" if multiple requests are allowed to access a session concurrently.WebRequest or NativeWebRequest. Allows for generic request parameter access as well as request/session attribute access, without ties to the native Servlet/Portlet API. Locale for the current request locale (determined by the most specific locale resolver available, i.e. the configured LocaleResolver in a Servlet environment and the portal locale in a Portlet environment). InputStream / Reader for access to the request's content. This will be the raw InputStream/Reader as exposed by the Servlet/Portlet API. OutputStream / Writer for generating the response's content. This will be the raw OutputStream/Writer as exposed by the Servlet/Portlet API. HttpMethod for the HTTP request method@PathVariable annotated parameters (Servlet-only) for access to URI template values (i.e. /hotels/{hotel}). Variable values will be converted to the declared method argument type. By default, the URI template will match against the regular expression [^\.]* (i.e. any character other than period), but this can be changed by specifying another regular expression, like so: /hotels/{hotel:\d+}. Additionally, @PathVariable can be used on a Map<String, String> to gain access to all URI template variables. @MatrixVariable annotated parameters (Servlet-only) for access to name-value pairs located in URI path segments. Matrix variables must be represented with a URI template variable. For example /hotels/{hotel} where the incoming URL may be "/hotels/42;q=1". Additionally, @MatrixVariable can be used on a Map<String, String> to gain access to all matrix variables in the URL or to those in a specific path variable. @RequestParam annotated parameters for access to specific Servlet/Portlet request parameters. Parameter values will be converted to the declared method argument type. Additionally, @RequestParam can be used on a Map<String, String> or MultiValueMap<String, String> method parameter to gain access to all request parameters. @RequestHeader annotated parameters for access to specific Servlet/Portlet request HTTP headers. Parameter values will be converted to the declared method argument type. Additionally, @RequestHeader can be used on a Map<String, String>, MultiValueMap<String, String>, or HttpHeaders method parameter to gain access to all request headers. @RequestBody annotated parameters (Servlet-only) for access to the Servlet request HTTP contents. The request stream will be converted to the declared method argument type using message converters. Such parameters may optionally be annotated with @Valid and also support access to validation results through an Errors argument. Instead a MethodArgumentNotValidException exception is raised. @RequestPart annotated parameters (Servlet-only, @MVC 3.1-only) for access to the content of a part of "multipart/form-data" request. The request part stream will be converted to the declared method argument type using message converters. Such parameters may optionally be annotated with @Valid and support access to validation results through a Errors argument. Instead a MethodArgumentNotValidException exception is raised. @SessionAttribute annotated parameters for access to existing, permanent session attributes (e.g. user authentication object) as opposed to model attributes temporarily stored in the session as part of a controller workflow via SessionAttributes. @RequestAttribute annotated parameters for access to request attributes. HttpEntity<?> parameters (Servlet-only) for access to the Servlet request HTTP headers and contents. The request stream will be converted to the entity body using message converters. Map / Model / ModelMap for enriching the implicit model that will be exposed to the web view. RedirectAttributes (Servlet-only, @MVC 3.1-only) to specify the exact set of attributes to use in case of a redirect and also to add flash attributes (attributes stored temporarily on the server-side to make them available to the request after the redirect). RedirectAttributes is used instead of the implicit model if the method returns a "redirect:" prefixed view name or RedirectView. Command/form objects to bind parameters to: as bean properties or fields, with customizable type conversion, depending on InitBinder methods and/or the HandlerAdapter configuration - see the "webBindingInitializer" property on RequestMappingHandlerMethodAdapter. Such command objects along with their validation results will be exposed as model attributes, by default using the non-qualified command class name in property notation (e.g. "orderAddress" for type "mypackage.OrderAddress"). Specify a parameter-level @ModelAttribute annotation for declaring a specific model attribute name. Errors / BindingResult validation results for a preceding command/form object (the immediate preceding argument). SessionStatus status handle for marking form processing as complete (triggering the cleanup of session attributes that have been indicated by the @SessionAttributes annotation at the handler type level). UriComponentsBuilder (Servlet-only, @MVC 3.1-only) for preparing a URL relative to the current request's host, port, scheme, context path, and the literal part of the servlet mapping. Note: Java 8's java.util.Optional is supported as a method parameter type with annotations that provide a required attribute (e.g. @RequestParam, @RequestHeader, etc.). The use of java.util.Optional in those cases is equivalent to having required=false. The following return types are supported for handler methods: A ModelAndView object (Servlet MVC or Portlet MVC), with the model implicitly enriched with command objects and the results of @ModelAttribute annotated reference data accessor methods. A Model object, with the view name implicitly determined through a RequestToViewNameTranslator and the model implicitly enriched with command objects and the results of @ModelAttribute annotated reference data accessor methods. A Map object for exposing a model, with the view name implicitly determined through a RequestToViewNameTranslator and the model implicitly enriched with command objects and the results of @ModelAttribute annotated reference data accessor methods. A View object, with the model implicitly determined through command objects and @ModelAttribute annotated reference data accessor methods. The handler method may also programmatically enrich the model by declaring a Model argument (see above). A String value which is interpreted as view name, with the model implicitly determined through command objects and @ModelAttribute annotated reference data accessor methods. The handler method may also programmatically enrich the model by declaring a ModelMap argument (see above). @ResponseBody annotated methods (Servlet-only) for access to the Servlet response HTTP contents. The return value will be converted to the response stream using message converters. An HttpEntity<?> or ResponseEntity<?> object (Servlet-only) to access to the Servlet response HTTP headers and contents. The entity body will be converted to the response stream using message converters. An HttpHeaders object to return a response with no body.A Callable which is used by Spring MVC to obtain the return value asynchronously in a separate thread transparently managed by Spring MVC on behalf of the application. A DeferredResult which the application uses to produce a return value in a separate thread of its own choosing, as an alternative to returning a Callable. A ListenableFuture which the application uses to produce a return value in a separate thread of its own choosing, as an alternative to returning a Callable. A CompletionStage (implemented by CompletableFuture for example) which the application uses to produce a return value in a separate thread of its own choosing, as an alternative to returning a Callable. A ResponseBodyEmitter can be used to write multiple objects to the response asynchronously; also supported as the body within ResponseEntity.An SseEmitter can be used to write Server-Sent Events to the response asynchronously; also supported as the body within ResponseEntity.A StreamingResponseBody can be used to write to the response asynchronously; also supported as the body within ResponseEntity.void if the method handles the response itself (by writing the response content directly, declaring an argument of type ServletResponse / HttpServletResponse / RenderResponse for that purpose) or if the view name is supposed to be implicitly determined through a RequestToViewNameTranslator (not declaring a response argument in the handler method signature; only applicable in a Servlet environment). Any other return type will be considered as single model attribute to be exposed to the view, using the attribute name specified through @ModelAttribute at the method level (or the default attribute name based on the return type's class name otherwise). The model will be implicitly enriched with command objects and the results of @ModelAttribute annotated reference data accessor methods. NOTE: @RequestMapping will only be processed if an an appropriate HandlerMapping-HandlerAdapter pair is configured. This is the case by default in both the DispatcherServlet and the DispatcherPortlet. However, if you are defining custom HandlerMappings or HandlerAdapters, then you need to add DefaultAnnotationHandlerMapping and AnnotationMethodHandlerAdapter to your configuration.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/bind/annotation/RequestMapping.html
RequestMethod	A										<section class="prog__container">Java 5 enumeration of HTTP request methods. Intended for use with the RequestMapping.method() attribute of the RequestMapping annotation. Note that, by default, DispatcherServlet supports GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE only. DispatcherServlet will process TRACE and OPTIONS with the default HttpServlet behavior unless explicitly told to dispatch those request types as well: Check out the "dispatchOptionsRequest" and "dispatchTraceRequest" properties, switching them to "true" if necessary.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/bind/annotation/RequestMethod.html
RequestParam	A										<section class="prog__container">Annotation which indicates that a method parameter should be bound to a web request parameter. Supported for annotated handler methods in Servlet and Portlet environments. If the method parameter type is Map and a request parameter name is specified, then the request parameter value is converted to a Map assuming an appropriate conversion strategy is available. If the method parameter is Map<String, String> or MultiValueMap<String, String> and a parameter name is not specified, then the map parameter is populated with all request parameter names and values.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/bind/annotation/RequestParam.html
RequestPart	A										<section class="prog__container">Annotation that can be used to associate the part of a "multipart/form-data" request with a method argument. Supported method argument types include MultipartFile in conjunction with Spring's MultipartResolver abstraction, javax.servlet.http.Part in conjunction with Servlet 3.0 multipart requests, or otherwise for any other method argument, the content of the part is passed through an HttpMessageConverter taking into consideration the 'Content-Type' header of the request part. This is analogous to what @RequestBody does to resolve an argument based on the content of a non-multipart regular request. Note that @RequestParam annotation can also be used to associate the part of a "multipart/form-data" request with a method argument supporting the same method argument types. The main difference is that when the method argument is not a String, @RequestParam relies on type conversion via a registered Converter or PropertyEditor while @RequestPart relies on HttpMessageConverters taking into consideration the 'Content-Type' header of the request part. @RequestParam is likely to be used with name-value form fields while @RequestPart is likely to be used with parts containing more complex content (e.g. JSON, XML).</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/bind/annotation/RequestPart.html
ResponseBody	A										<section class="prog__container">Annotation that indicates a method return value should be bound to the web response body. Supported for annotated handler methods in Servlet environments. As of version 4.0 this annotation can also be added on the type level in which case it is inherited and does not need to be added on the method level.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/bind/annotation/ResponseBody.html
ResponseStatus	A										<section class="prog__container">Marks a method or exception class with the status code() and reason() that should be returned. The status code is applied to the HTTP response when the handler method is invoked and overrides status information set by other means, like ResponseEntity or "redirect:". Warning: when using this annotation on an exception class, or when setting the reason attribute of this annotation, the HttpServletResponse.sendError method will be used. With HttpServletResponse.sendError, the response is considered complete and should not be written to any further. Furthermore, the Servlet container will typically write an HTML error page therefore making the use of a reason unsuitable for REST APIs. For such cases it is preferable to use a ResponseEntity as a return type and avoid the use of @ResponseStatus altogether. Note that a controller class may also be annotated with @ResponseStatus and is then inherited by all @RequestMapping methods.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/bind/annotation/ResponseStatus.html
RestController	A										<section class="prog__container">A convenience annotation that is itself annotated with @Controller and @ResponseBody.  Types that carry this annotation are treated as controllers where @RequestMapping methods assume @ResponseBody semantics by default. NOTE: @RestController is processed if an appropriate HandlerMapping-HandlerAdapter pair is configured such as the RequestMappingHandlerMapping-RequestMappingHandlerAdapter pair which are the default in the MVC Java config and the MVC namespace. In particular @RestController is not supported with the DefaultAnnotationHandlerMapping-AnnotationMethodHandlerAdapter pair both of which are also deprecated.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/bind/annotation/RestController.html
RestControllerAdvice	A										<section class="prog__container">A convenience annotation that is itself annotated with @ControllerAdvice and @ResponseBody. Types that carry this annotation are treated as controller advice where @ExceptionHandler methods assume @ResponseBody semantics by default. NOTE: @RestControllerAdvice is processed if an appropriate HandlerMapping-HandlerAdapter pair is configured such as the RequestMappingHandlerMapping-RequestMappingHandlerAdapter pair which are the default in the MVC Java config and the MVC namespace. In particular @RestControllerAdvice is not supported with the DefaultAnnotationHandlerMapping-AnnotationMethodHandlerAdapter pair both of which are also deprecated.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/bind/annotation/RestControllerAdvice.html
SessionAttribute	A										<section class="prog__container">Annotation to bind a method parameter to a session attribute. The main motivation is to provide convenient access to existing, permanent session attributes (e.g. user authentication object) with an optional/required check and a cast to the target method parameter type. For use cases that require adding or removing session attributes consider injecting org.springframework.web.context.request.WebRequest or javax.servlet.http.HttpSession into the controller method. For temporary storage of model attributes in the session as part of the workflow for a controller, consider using SessionAttributes instead.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/bind/annotation/SessionAttribute.html
SessionAttributes	A										<section class="prog__container">Annotation that indicates the session attributes that a specific handler uses. This will typically list the names of model attributes which should be transparently stored in the session or some conversational storage, serving as form-backing beans. Declared at the type level, applying to the model attributes that the annotated handler class operates on. NOTE: Session attributes as indicated using this annotation correspond to a specific handler's model attributes, getting transparently stored in a conversational session. Those attributes will be removed once the handler indicates completion of its conversational session. Therefore, use this facility for such conversational attributes which are supposed to be stored in the session temporarily during the course of a specific handler's conversation. For permanent session attributes, e.g. a user authentication object, use the traditional session.setAttribute method instead. Alternatively, consider using the attribute management capabilities of the generic WebRequest interface. NOTE: When using controller interfaces (e.g. for AOP proxying), make sure to consistently put all your mapping annotations — such as @RequestMapping and @SessionAttributes — on the controller interface rather than on the implementation class.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/bind/annotation/SessionAttributes.html

See the DataBinder/WebDataBinder superclasses for customization options, which include specifying allowed/required fields, and registering custom property editors. Can also used for manual data binding in custom web controllers or interceptors that build on Spring's WebRequest abstraction: e.g. in a WebRequestInterceptor implementation. Simply instantiate a WebRequestDataBinder for each binding process, and invoke bind with the current WebRequest as argument:  MyBean myBean = new MyBean(); // apply binder to custom target object WebRequestDataBinder binder = new WebRequestDataBinder(myBean); // register custom editors, if desired binder.registerCustomEditor(...); // trigger actual binding of request parameters binder.bind(request); // optionally evaluate binding errors Errors errors = binder.getErrors(); ...</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/bind/support/WebRequestDataBinder.html

AsyncRestTemplate	A										<section class="prog__container">Spring's central class for asynchronous client-side HTTP access. Exposes similar methods as RestTemplate, but returns ListenableFuture wrappers as opposed to concrete results. The AsyncRestTemplate exposes a synchronous RestTemplate via the getRestOperations() method, and it shares its error handler and message converters with this RestTemplate. Note: by default AsyncRestTemplate relies on standard JDK facilities to establish HTTP connections. You can switch to use a different HTTP library such as Apache HttpComponents, Netty, and OkHttp by using a constructor accepting an AsyncClientHttpRequestFactory. For more information, please refer to the RestTemplate API documentation.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/client/AsyncRestTemplate.html
DefaultResponseErrorHandler	A										<section class="prog__container">Default implementation of the ResponseErrorHandler interface.

RestTemplate	A										<section class="prog__container">Spring's central class for synchronous client-side HTTP access. It simplifies communication with HTTP servers, and enforces RESTful principles. It handles HTTP connections, leaving application code to provide URLs (with possible template variables) and extract results. Note: by default the RestTemplate relies on standard JDK facilities to establish HTTP connections. You can switch to use a different HTTP library such as Apache HttpComponents, Netty, and OkHttp through the HttpAccessor.setRequestFactory(org.springframework.http.client.ClientHttpRequestFactory) property. The main entry points of this template are the methods named after the six main HTTP methods: HTTP methodRestTemplate methodsDELETEdelete(java.lang.String, java.lang.Object...)GETgetForObject(java.lang.String, java.lang.Class<T>, java.lang.Object...)getForEntity(java.lang.String, java.lang.Class<T>, java.lang.Object...)HEADheadForHeaders(java.lang.String, java.lang.Object...)OPTIONSoptionsForAllow(java.lang.String, java.lang.Object...)POSTpostForLocation(java.lang.String, java.lang.Object, java.lang.Object...)postForObject(java.lang.String, java.lang.Object, java.lang.Class<T>, java.lang.Object...)PUTput(java.lang.String, java.lang.Object, java.lang.Object...)anyexchange(java.lang.String, org.springframework.http.HttpMethod, org.springframework.http.HttpEntity<?>, java.lang.Class<T>, java.lang.Object...)execute(java.lang.String, org.springframework.http.HttpMethod, org.springframework.web.client.RequestCallback, org.springframework.web.client.ResponseExtractor<T>, java.lang.Object...) In addition the exchange and execute methods are generalized versions of the above methods and can be used to support additional, less frequent combinations (e.g. HTTP PATCH, HTTP PUT with response body, etc.). Note however that the underlying HTTP library used must also support the desired combination. For each HTTP method there are three variants: two accept a URI template string and URI variables (array or map) while a third accepts a URI. Note that for URI templates it is assumed encoding is necessary, e.g. restTemplate.getForObject("http://example.com/hotel list") becomes "http://example.com/hotel%20list". This also means if the URI template or URI variables are already encoded, double encoding will occur, e.g. http://example.com/hotel%20list becomes http://example.com/hotel%2520list). To avoid that use a URI method variant to provide (or re-use) a previously encoded URI. To prepare such an URI with full control over encoding, consider using UriComponentsBuilder. Internally the template uses HttpMessageConverter instances to convert HTTP messages to and from POJOs. Converters for the main mime types are registered by default but you can also register additional converters via setMessageConverters(java.util.List<org.springframework.http.converter.HttpMessageConverter<?>>). This template uses a SimpleClientHttpRequestFactory and a DefaultResponseErrorHandler as default strategies for creating HTTP connections or handling HTTP errors, respectively. These defaults can be overridden through HttpAccessor.setRequestFactory(org.springframework.http.client.ClientHttpRequestFactory) and setErrorHandler(org.springframework.web.client.ResponseErrorHandler) respectively.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/client/RestTemplate.html

RestGatewaySupport	A										<section class="prog__container">Convenient super class for application classes that need REST access. Requires a ClientHttpRequestFactory or a RestTemplate instance to be set.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/client/support/RestGatewaySupport.html
AbstractContextLoaderInitializer	A										<section class="prog__container">Convenient base class for WebApplicationInitializer implementations that register a ContextLoaderListener in the servlet context. The only method required to be implemented by subclasses is createRootApplicationContext(), which gets invoked from registerContextLoaderListener(ServletContext).</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/context/AbstractContextLoaderInitializer.html
ConfigurableWebApplicationContext	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface to be implemented by configurable web application contexts. Supported by ContextLoader and FrameworkServlet. Note: The setters of this interface need to be called before an invocation of the ConfigurableApplicationContext.refresh() method inherited from ConfigurableApplicationContext. They do not cause an initialization of the context on their own.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/context/ConfigurableWebApplicationContext.html
ConfigurableWebEnvironment	A										<section class="prog__container">Specialization of ConfigurableEnvironment allowing initialization of servlet-related PropertySource objects at the earliest moment that the ServletContext and (optionally) ServletConfig become available.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/context/ConfigurableWebEnvironment.html
ContextCleanupListener	A										<section class="prog__container">Web application listener that cleans up remaining disposable attributes in the ServletContext, i.e. attributes which implement DisposableBean and haven't been removed before. This is typically used for destroying objects in "application" scope, for which the lifecycle implies destruction at the very end of the web application's shutdown phase.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/context/ContextCleanupListener.html
ContextLoader	A										<section class="prog__container">Performs the actual initialization work for the root application context. Called by ContextLoaderListener. Looks for a "contextClass" parameter at the web.xml context-param level to specify the context class type, falling back to XmlWebApplicationContext if not found. With the default ContextLoader implementation, any context class specified needs to implement the ConfigurableWebApplicationContext interface. Processes a "contextConfigLocation" context-param and passes its value to the context instance, parsing it into potentially multiple file paths which can be separated by any number of commas and spaces, e.g. "WEB-INF/applicationContext1.xml, WEB-INF/applicationContext2.xml". Ant-style path patterns are supported as well, e.g. "WEB-INF/*Context.xml,WEB-INF/spring*.xml" or "WEB-INF/**/*Context.xml". If not explicitly specified, the context implementation is supposed to use a default location (with XmlWebApplicationContext: "/WEB-INF/applicationContext.xml"). Note: In case of multiple config locations, later bean definitions will override ones defined in previously loaded files, at least when using one of Spring's default ApplicationContext implementations. This can be leveraged to deliberately override certain bean definitions via an extra XML file. Above and beyond loading the root application context, this class can optionally load or obtain and hook up a shared parent context to the root application context. See the loadParentContext(ServletContext) method for more information. As of Spring 3.1, ContextLoader supports injecting the root web application context via the ContextLoader(WebApplicationContext) constructor, allowing for programmatic configuration in Servlet 3.0+ environments. See WebApplicationInitializer for usage examples.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/context/ContextLoader.html
ContextLoaderListener	A										<section class="prog__container">Bootstrap listener to start up and shut down Spring's root WebApplicationContext. Simply delegates to ContextLoader as well as to ContextCleanupListener. This listener should be registered after Log4jConfigListener in web.xml, if the latter is used. As of Spring 3.1, ContextLoaderListener supports injecting the root web application context via the ContextLoaderListener(WebApplicationContext) constructor, allowing for programmatic configuration in Servlet 3.0+ environments. See WebApplicationInitializer for usage examples.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/context/ContextLoaderListener.html
ServletConfigAware	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface to be implemented by any object that wishes to be notified of the ServletConfig (typically determined by the WebApplicationContext) that it runs in.

Otherwise, no ServletConfig will be set.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/context/ServletConfigAware.html
ServletContextAware	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface to be implemented by any object that wishes to be notified of the ServletContext (typically determined by the WebApplicationContext) that it runs in.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/context/ServletContextAware.html
WebApplicationContext	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface to provide configuration for a web application. This is read-only while the application is running, but may be reloaded if the implementation supports this. This interface adds a getServletContext() method to the generic ApplicationContext interface, and defines a well-known application attribute name that the root context must be bound to in the bootstrap process. Like generic application contexts, web application contexts are hierarchical. There is a single root context per application, while each servlet in the application (including a dispatcher servlet in the MVC framework) has its own child context. In addition to standard application context lifecycle capabilities, WebApplicationContext implementations need to detect ServletContextAware beans and invoke the setServletContext method accordingly.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/context/WebApplicationContext.html
ApplicationScope	A										<section class="prog__container">@ApplicationScope is a specialization of @Scope for a component whose lifecycle is bound to the current web application. Specifically, @ApplicationScope is a composed annotation that acts as a shortcut for @Scope("application") with the default proxyMode() set to TARGET_CLASS. @ApplicationScope may be used as a meta-annotation to create custom composed annotations.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/context/annotation/ApplicationScope.html
RequestScope	A										<section class="prog__container">@RequestScope is a specialization of @Scope for a component whose lifecycle is bound to the current web request. Specifically, @RequestScope is a composed annotation that acts as a shortcut for @Scope("request") with the default proxyMode() set to TARGET_CLASS. @RequestScope may be used as a meta-annotation to create custom composed annotations.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/context/annotation/RequestScope.html
SessionScope	A										<section class="prog__container">@SessionScope is a specialization of @Scope for a component whose lifecycle is bound to the current web session. Specifically, @SessionScope is a composed annotation that acts as a shortcut for @Scope("session") with the default proxyMode() set to TARGET_CLASS. @SessionScope may be used as a meta-annotation to create custom composed annotations.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/context/annotation/SessionScope.html

AbstractRequestAttributesScope	A										<section class="prog__container">Abstract Scope implementation that reads from a particular scope in the current thread-bound RequestAttributes object. Subclasses simply need to implement getScope() to instruct this class which RequestAttributes scope to read attributes from. Subclasses may wish to override the get(java.lang.String, org.springframework.beans.factory.ObjectFactory<?>) and remove(java.lang.String) methods to add synchronization around the call back into this super class.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/context/request/AbstractRequestAttributesScope.html
AsyncWebRequestInterceptor	A										<section class="prog__container">Extends WebRequestInterceptor with a callback method invoked during asynchronous request handling. When a handler starts asynchronous request handling, the DispatcherServlet exits without invoking postHandle and afterCompletion, as it normally does, since the results of request handling (e.g. ModelAndView) are not available in the current thread and handling is not yet complete. In such scenarios, the afterConcurrentHandlingStarted(WebRequest) method is invoked instead allowing implementations to perform tasks such as cleaning up thread bound attributes. When asynchronous handling completes, the request is dispatched to the container for further processing. At this stage the DispatcherServlet invokes preHandle, postHandle and afterCompletion as usual.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/context/request/AsyncWebRequestInterceptor.html
DestructionCallbackBindingListener	A										<section class="prog__container">Adapter that implements the Servlet HttpSessionBindingListener interface, wrapping a session destruction callback.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/context/request/DestructionCallbackBindingListener.html
FacesRequestAttributes	A										<section class="prog__container">RequestAttributes adapter for a JSF FacesContext. Used as default in a JSF environment, wrapping the current FacesContext. NOTE: In contrast to ServletRequestAttributes, this variant does not support destruction callbacks for scoped attributes, neither for the request scope nor for the session scope. If you rely on such implicit destruction callbacks, consider defining a Spring RequestContextListener in your web.xml. Requires JSF 2.0 or higher, as of Spring 4.0.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/context/request/FacesRequestAttributes.html

Mainly intended for framework-internal usage, in particular for generic argument resolution code.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/context/request/NativeWebRequest.html
RequestAttributes	A										<section class="prog__container">Abstraction for accessing attribute objects associated with a request. Supports access to request-scoped attributes as well as to session-scoped attributes, with the optional notion of a "global session". Can be implemented for any kind of request/session mechanism, in particular for servlet requests and portlet requests.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/context/request/RequestAttributes.html
RequestContextHolder	A										<section class="prog__container">Holder class to expose the web request in the form of a thread-bound RequestAttributes object. The request will be inherited by any child threads spawned by the current thread if the inheritable flag is set to true. Use RequestContextListener or RequestContextFilter to expose the current web request. Note that DispatcherServlet and DispatcherPortlet already expose the current request by default.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/context/request/RequestContextHolder.html
RequestContextListener	A										<section class="prog__container">Servlet listener that exposes the request to the current thread, through both LocaleContextHolder and RequestContextHolder. To be registered as listener in web.xml. Alternatively, Spring's RequestContextFilter and Spring's DispatcherServlet also expose the same request context to the current thread. In contrast to this listener, advanced options are available there (e.g. "threadContextInheritable"). This listener is mainly for use with third-party servlets, e.g. the JSF FacesServlet. Within Spring's own web support, DispatcherServlet's processing is perfectly sufficient.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/context/request/RequestContextListener.html
RequestScope	A										<section class="prog__container">Request-backed Scope implementation.

WebRequest	A										<section class="prog__container">Generic interface for a web request. Mainly intended for generic web request interceptors, giving them access to general request metadata, not for actual handling of the request.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/context/request/WebRequest.html
WebRequestInterceptor	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface for general web request interception. Allows for being applied to Servlet request as well as Portlet request environments, by building on the WebRequest abstraction. This interface assumes MVC-style request processing: A handler gets executed, exposes a set of model objects, then a view gets rendered based on that model. Alternatively, a handler may also process the request completely, with no view to be rendered. In an async processing scenario, the handler may be executed in a separate thread while the main thread exits without rendering or invoking the postHandle and afterCompletion callbacks. When concurrent handler execution completes, the request is dispatched back in order to proceed with rendering the model and all methods of this contract are invoked again. For further options and comments see org.springframework.web.context.request.async.AsyncWebRequestInterceptorThis interface is deliberately minimalistic to keep the dependencies of generic request interceptors as minimal as feasible. NOTE: While this interceptor is applied to the entire request processing in a Servlet environment, it is by default only applied to the render phase in a Portlet environment, preparing and rendering a Portlet view. To apply WebRequestInterceptors to the action phase as well, set the HandlerMapping's "applyWebRequestInterceptorsToRenderPhaseOnly" flag to "false". Alternatively, consider using the Portlet-specific HandlerInterceptor mechanism for such needs.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/context/request/WebRequestInterceptor.html
AsyncRequestTimeoutException	A										<section class="prog__container">Exception to be thrown when an async request times out. Alternatively an applications can register a DeferredResultProcessingInterceptor or a CallableProcessingInterceptor to handle the timeout through the MVC Java config or the MVC XML namespace or directly through properties of the RequestMappingHandlerAdapter. By default the exception will be handled as a 503 error.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/context/request/async/AsyncRequestTimeoutException.html

CallableProcessingInterceptor	A										<section class="prog__container">Intercepts concurrent request handling, where the concurrent result is obtained by executing a Callable on behalf of the application with an AsyncTaskExecutor. A CallableProcessingInterceptor is invoked before and after the invocation of the Callable task in the asynchronous thread, as well as on timeout from a container thread, or after completing for any reason including a timeout or network error. As a general rule exceptions raised by interceptor methods will cause async processing to resume by dispatching back to the container and using the Exception instance as the concurrent result. Such exceptions will then be processed through the HandlerExceptionResolver mechanism. The afterTimeout method can select a value to be used to resume processing.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/context/request/async/CallableProcessingInterceptor.html
CallableProcessingInterceptorAdapter	A										<section class="prog__container">Abstract adapter class for the CallableProcessingInterceptor interface, for simplified implementation of individual methods.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/context/request/async/CallableProcessingInterceptorAdapter.html

DeferredResult	A										<section class="prog__container">DeferredResult provides an alternative to using a Callable for asynchronous request processing. While a Callable is executed concurrently on behalf of the application, with a DeferredResult the application can produce the result from a thread of its choice. Subclasses can extend this class to easily associate additional data or behavior with the DeferredResult. For example, one might want to associate the user used to create the DeferredResult by extending the class and adding an additional property for the user. In this way, the user could easily be accessed later without the need to use a data structure to do the mapping. An example of associating additional behavior to this class might be realized by extending the class to implement an additional interface. For example, one might want to implement Comparable so that when the DeferredResult is added to a PriorityQueue it is handled in the correct order.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/context/request/async/DeferredResult.html
DeferredResultProcessingInterceptor	A										<section class="prog__container">Intercepts concurrent request handling, where the concurrent result is obtained by waiting for a DeferredResult to be set from a thread chosen by the application (e.g. in response to some external event). A DeferredResultProcessingInterceptor is invoked before the start of async processing, after the DeferredResult is set as well as on timeout, or after completing for any reason including a timeout or network error. As a general rule exceptions raised by interceptor methods will cause async processing to resume by dispatching back to the container and using the Exception instance as the concurrent result. Such exceptions will then be processed through the HandlerExceptionResolver mechanism. The afterTimeout method can set the DeferredResult in order to resume processing.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/context/request/async/DeferredResultProcessingInterceptor.html

TimeoutCallableProcessingInterceptor	A										<section class="prog__container">Sends a 503 (SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE) in case of a timeout if the response is not already committed. As of 4.2.8 this is done indirectly by setting the result to an AsyncRequestTimeoutException which is then handled by Spring MVC's default exception handling as a 503 error. Registered at the end, after all other interceptors and therefore invoked only if no other interceptor handles the timeout. Note that according to RFC 7231, a 503 without a 'Retry-After' header is interpreted as a 500 error and the client should not retry. Applications can install their own interceptor to handle a timeout and add a 'Retry-After' header if necessary.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/context/request/async/TimeoutCallableProcessingInterceptor.html
TimeoutDeferredResultProcessingInterceptor	A										<section class="prog__container">Sends a 503 (SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE) in case of a timeout if the response is not already committed. As of 4.2.8 this is done indirectly by returning AsyncRequestTimeoutException as the result of processing which is then handled by Spring MVC's default exception handling as a 503 error. Registered at the end, after all other interceptors and therefore invoked only if no other interceptor handles the timeout.

WebAsyncManager	A										<section class="prog__container">The central class for managing asynchronous request processing, mainly intended as an SPI and not typically used directly by application classes. An async scenario starts with request processing as usual in a thread (T1). Concurrent request handling can be initiated by calling startCallableProcessing or startDeferredResultProcessing, both of which produce a result in a separate thread (T2). The result is saved and the request dispatched to the container, to resume processing with the saved result in a third thread (T3). Within the dispatched thread (T3), the saved result can be accessed via getConcurrentResult() or its presence detected via hasConcurrentResult().</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/context/request/async/WebAsyncManager.html

AbstractRefreshableWebApplicationContext	A										<section class="prog__container">AbstractRefreshableApplicationContext subclass which implements the ConfigurableWebApplicationContext interface for web environments. Provides a "configLocations" property, to be populated through the ConfigurableWebApplicationContext interface on web application startup. This class is as easy to subclass as AbstractRefreshableApplicationContext: All you need to implements is the AbstractRefreshableApplicationContext.loadBeanDefinitions(org.springframework.beans.factory.support.DefaultListableBeanFactory) method; see the superclass javadoc for details. Note that implementations are supposed to load bean definitions from the files specified by the locations returned by the getConfigLocations() method. Interprets resource paths as servlet context resources, i.e. as paths beneath the web application root. Absolute paths, e.g. for files outside the web app root, can be accessed via "file:" URLs, as implemented by DefaultResourceLoader. In addition to the special beans detected by AbstractApplicationContext, this class detects a bean of type ThemeSource in the context, under the special bean name "themeSource". This is the web context to be subclassed for a different bean definition format. Such a context implementation can be specified as "contextClass" context-param for ContextLoader or as "contextClass" init-param for FrameworkServlet, replacing the default XmlWebApplicationContext. It will then automatically receive the "contextConfigLocation" context-param or init-param, respectively. Note that WebApplicationContext implementations are generally supposed to configure themselves based on the configuration received through the ConfigurableWebApplicationContext interface. In contrast, a standalone application context might allow for configuration in custom startup code (for example, GenericApplicationContext).</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/context/support/AbstractRefreshableWebApplicationContext.html
AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext	A										<section class="prog__container">WebApplicationContext implementation which accepts annotated classes as input - in particular @Configuration-annotated classes, but also plain @Component classes and JSR-330 compliant classes using javax.inject annotations. Allows for registering classes one by one (specifying class names as config location) as well as for classpath scanning (specifying base packages as config location). This is essentially the equivalent of AnnotationConfigApplicationContext for a web environment. To make use of this application context, the "contextClass" context-param for ContextLoader and/or "contextClass" init-param for FrameworkServlet must be set to the fully-qualified name of this class. As of Spring 3.1, this class may also be directly instantiated and injected into Spring's DispatcherServlet or ContextLoaderListener when using the new WebApplicationInitializer code-based alternative to web.xml. See its Javadoc for details and usage examples. Unlike XmlWebApplicationContext, no default configuration class locations are assumed. Rather, it is a requirement to set the "contextConfigLocation" context-param for ContextLoader and/or "contextConfigLocation" init-param for FrameworkServlet.  The param-value may contain both fully-qualified class names and base packages to scan for components. See loadBeanDefinitions(org.springframework.beans.factory.support.DefaultListableBeanFactory) for exact details on how these locations are processed. As an alternative to setting the "contextConfigLocation" parameter, users may implement an ApplicationContextInitializer and set the "contextInitializerClasses" context-param / init-param. In such cases, users should favor the AbstractApplicationContext.refresh() and scan(String...) methods over the AbstractRefreshableConfigApplicationContext.setConfigLocation(String) method, which is primarily for use by ContextLoader. Note: In case of multiple @Configuration classes, later @Bean definitions will override ones defined in earlier loaded files. This can be leveraged to deliberately override certain bean definitions via an extra Configuration class.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/context/support/AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext.html
ContextExposingHttpServletRequest	A										<section class="prog__container">HttpServletRequest decorator that makes all Spring beans in a given WebApplicationContext accessible as request attributes, through lazy checking once an attribute gets accessed.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/context/support/ContextExposingHttpServletRequest.html
GenericWebApplicationContext	A										<section class="prog__container">Subclass of GenericApplicationContext, suitable for web environments. Implements the ConfigurableWebApplicationContext, but is not intended for declarative setup in web.xml. Instead, it is designed for programmatic setup, for example for building nested contexts or for use within Spring 3.1 WebApplicationInitializers. If you intend to implement a WebApplicationContext that reads bean definitions from configuration files, consider deriving from AbstractRefreshableWebApplicationContext, reading the bean definitions in an implementation of the loadBeanDefinitions method.Interprets resource paths as servlet context resources, i.e. as paths beneath the web application root. Absolute paths, e.g. for files outside the web app root, can be accessed via "file:" URLs, as implemented by AbstractApplicationContext. In addition to the special beans detected by AbstractApplicationContext, this class detects a ThemeSource bean in the context, with the name "themeSource".</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/context/support/GenericWebApplicationContext.html
GroovyWebApplicationContext	A										<section class="prog__container">WebApplicationContext implementation which takes its configuration from Groovy bean definition scripts and/or XML files, as understood by an GroovyBeanDefinitionReader. This is essentially the equivalent of GenericGroovyApplicationContext for a web environment. By default, the configuration will be taken from "/WEB-INF/applicationContext.groovy" for the root context, and "/WEB-INF/test-servlet.groovy" for a context with the namespace "test-servlet" (like for a DispatcherServlet instance with the servlet-name "test"). The config location defaults can be overridden via the "contextConfigLocation" context-param of ContextLoader and servlet init-param of FrameworkServlet. Config locations can either denote concrete files like "/WEB-INF/context.groovy" or Ant-style patterns like "/WEB-INF/*-context.groovy" (see PathMatcher javadoc for pattern details). Note that ".xml" files will be parsed as XML content; all other kinds of resources will be parsed as Groovy scripts. Note: In case of multiple config locations, later bean definitions will override ones defined in earlier loaded files. This can be leveraged to deliberately override certain bean definitions via an extra Groovy script. For a WebApplicationContext that reads in a different bean definition format, create an analogous subclass of AbstractRefreshableWebApplicationContext. Such a context implementation can be specified as "contextClass" context-param for ContextLoader or "contextClass" init-param for FrameworkServlet.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/context/support/GroovyWebApplicationContext.html
HttpRequestHandlerServlet	A										<section class="prog__container">Simple HttpServlet that delegates to an HttpRequestHandler bean defined in Spring's root web application context. The target bean name must match the HttpRequestHandlerServlet servlet-name as defined in web.xml. This can for example be used to expose a single Spring remote exporter, such as HttpInvokerServiceExporter or HessianServiceExporter, per HttpRequestHandlerServlet definition. This is a minimal alternative to defining remote exporters as beans in a DispatcherServlet context (with advanced mapping and interception facilities being available there).</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/context/support/HttpRequestHandlerServlet.html
LiveBeansViewServlet	A										<section class="prog__container">Servlet variant of LiveBeansView's MBean exposure.

ServletContextAttributeExporter	A										<section class="prog__container">Exporter that takes Spring-defined objects and exposes them as ServletContext attributes. Usually, bean references will be used to export Spring-defined beans as ServletContext attributes. Useful to make Spring-defined beans available to code that is not aware of Spring at all, but rather just of the Servlet API. Client code can then use plain ServletContext attribute lookups to access those objects, despite them being defined in a Spring application context. Alternatively, consider using the WebApplicationContextUtils class to access Spring-defined beans via the WebApplicationContext interface. This makes client code aware of Spring API, of course.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/context/support/ServletContextAttributeExporter.html
ServletContextAttributeFactoryBean	A										<section class="prog__container">FactoryBean that fetches a specific, existing ServletContext attribute. Exposes that ServletContext attribute when used as bean reference, effectively making it available as named Spring bean instance. Intended to link in ServletContext attributes that exist before the startup of the Spring application context. Typically, such attributes will have been put there by third-party web frameworks. In a purely Spring-based web application, no such linking in of ServletContext attributes will be necessary. NOTE: As of Spring 3.0, you may also use the "contextAttributes" default bean which is of type Map, and dereference it using an "#{contextAttributes.myKey}" expression to access a specific attribute by name.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/context/support/ServletContextAttributeFactoryBean.html
ServletContextAwareProcessor	A										<section class="prog__container">BeanPostProcessor implementation that passes the ServletContext to beans that implement the ServletContextAware interface. Web application contexts will automatically register this with their underlying bean factory. Applications do not use this directly.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/context/support/ServletContextAwareProcessor.html
ServletContextLiveBeansView	A										<section class="prog__container">LiveBeansView subclass which looks for all ApplicationContexts in the web application, as exposed in ServletContext attributes.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/context/support/ServletContextLiveBeansView.html
ServletContextParameterFactoryBean	A										<section class="prog__container">FactoryBean that retrieves a specific ServletContext init parameter (that is, a "context-param" defined in web.xml). Exposes that ServletContext init parameter when used as bean reference, effectively making it available as named Spring bean instance. NOTE: As of Spring 3.0, you may also use the "contextParameters" default bean which is of type Map, and dereference it using an "#{contextParameters.myKey}" expression to access a specific parameter by name.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/context/support/ServletContextParameterFactoryBean.html

ServletContextResourceLoader	A										<section class="prog__container">ResourceLoader implementation that resolves paths as ServletContext resources, for use outside a WebApplicationContext (for example, in an HttpServletBean or GenericFilterBean subclass). Within a WebApplicationContext, resource paths are automatically resolved as ServletContext resources by the context implementation.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/context/support/ServletContextResourceLoader.html
ServletContextResourcePatternResolver	A										<section class="prog__container">ServletContext-aware subclass of PathMatchingResourcePatternResolver, able to find matching resources below the web application root directory via ServletContext.getResourcePaths(java.lang.String). Falls back to the superclass' file system checking for other resources.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/context/support/ServletContextResourcePatternResolver.html
ServletContextScope	A										<section class="prog__container">Scope wrapper for a ServletContext, i.e. for global web application attributes. This differs from traditional Spring singletons in that it exposes attributes in the ServletContext. Those attributes will get destroyed whenever the entire application shuts down, which might be earlier or later than the shutdown of the containing Spring ApplicationContext. The associated destruction mechanism relies on a ContextCleanupListener being registered in web.xml. Note that ContextLoaderListener includes ContextCleanupListener's functionality. This scope is registered as default scope with key "application".</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/context/support/ServletContextScope.html

Resolves @Autowired annotations in the endpoint class against beans in the current Spring root web application context (as determined by the current thread's context ClassLoader, which needs to be the web application's ClassLoader). Can alternatively be used as a delegate instead of as a base class. A typical usage of this base class is a JAX-WS endpoint class: Such a Spring-based JAX-WS endpoint implementation will follow the standard JAX-WS contract for endpoint classes but will be 'thin' in that it delegates the actual work to one or more Spring-managed service beans - typically obtained using @Autowired. The lifecycle of such an endpoint instance will be managed by the JAX-WS runtime, hence the need for this base class to provide @Autowired processing based on the current Spring context. NOTE: If there is an explicit way to access the ServletContext, prefer such a way over using this class. The WebApplicationContextUtils class allows for easy access to the Spring root web application context based on the ServletContext.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/context/support/SpringBeanAutowiringSupport.html
StandardServletEnvironment	A										<section class="prog__container">Environment implementation to be used by Servlet-based web applications. All web-related (servlet-based) ApplicationContext classes initialize an instance by default. Contributes ServletConfig, ServletContext, and JNDI-based PropertySource instances. See customizePropertySources(org.springframework.core.env.MutablePropertySources) method documentation for details.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/context/support/StandardServletEnvironment.html
StaticWebApplicationContext	A										<section class="prog__container">Static WebApplicationContext implementation for testing. Not intended for use in production applications. Implements the ConfigurableWebApplicationContext interface to allow for direct replacement of an XmlWebApplicationContext, despite not actually supporting external configuration files. Interprets resource paths as servlet context resources, i.e. as paths beneath the web application root. Absolute paths, e.g. for files outside the web app root, can be accessed via "file:" URLs, as implemented by DefaultResourceLoader. In addition to the special beans detected by AbstractApplicationContext, this class detects a bean of type ThemeSource in the context, under the special bean name "themeSource".</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/context/support/StaticWebApplicationContext.html
WebApplicationContextUtils	A										<section class="prog__container">Convenience methods for retrieving the root WebApplicationContext for a given ServletContext. This is useful for programmatically accessing a Spring application context from within custom web views or MVC actions. Note that there are more convenient ways of accessing the root context for many web frameworks, either part of Spring or available as an external library. This helper class is just the most generic way to access the root context.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/context/support/WebApplicationContextUtils.html
WebApplicationObjectSupport	A										<section class="prog__container">Convenient superclass for application objects running in a WebApplicationContext. Provides getWebApplicationContext(), getServletContext(), and getTempDir() accessors. Note: It is generally recommended to use individual callback interfaces for the actual callbacks needed. This broad base class is primarily intended for use within the framework, in case of ServletContext access etc typically being needed.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/context/support/WebApplicationObjectSupport.html
XmlWebApplicationContext	A										<section class="prog__container">WebApplicationContext implementation which takes its configuration from XML documents, understood by an XmlBeanDefinitionReader. This is essentially the equivalent of GenericXmlApplicationContext for a web environment. By default, the configuration will be taken from "/WEB-INF/applicationContext.xml" for the root context, and "/WEB-INF/test-servlet.xml" for a context with the namespace "test-servlet" (like for a DispatcherServlet instance with the servlet-name "test"). The config location defaults can be overridden via the "contextConfigLocation" context-param of ContextLoader and servlet init-param of FrameworkServlet. Config locations can either denote concrete files like "/WEB-INF/context.xml" or Ant-style patterns like "/WEB-INF/*-context.xml" (see PathMatcher javadoc for pattern details). Note: In case of multiple config locations, later bean definitions will override ones defined in earlier loaded files. This can be leveraged to deliberately override certain bean definitions via an extra XML file. For a WebApplicationContext that reads in a different bean definition format, create an analogous subclass of AbstractRefreshableWebApplicationContext. Such a context implementation can be specified as "contextClass" context-param for ContextLoader or "contextClass" init-param for FrameworkServlet.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/context/support/XmlWebApplicationContext.html
CorsConfiguration	A										<section class="prog__container">A container for CORS configuration along with methods to check against the actual origin, HTTP methods, and headers of a given request. By default a newly created CorsConfiguration does not permit any cross-origin requests and must be configured explicitly to indicate what should be allowed. Use applyPermitDefaultValues() to flip the initialization model to start with open defaults that permit all cross-origin requests for GET, HEAD, and POST requests.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/cors/CorsConfiguration.html
CorsConfigurationSource	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface to be implemented by classes (usually HTTP request handlers) that provides a CorsConfiguration instance based on the provided request.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/cors/CorsConfigurationSource.html
CorsProcessor	A										<section class="prog__container">A strategy that takes a request and a CorsConfiguration and updates the response. This component is not concerned with how a CorsConfiguration is selected but rather takes follow-up actions such as applying CORS validation checks and either rejecting the response or adding CORS headers to the response.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/cors/CorsProcessor.html
CorsUtils	A										<section class="prog__container">Utility class for CORS request handling based on the CORS W3C recommandation.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/cors/CorsUtils.html
DefaultCorsProcessor	A										<section class="prog__container">The default implementation of CorsProcessor, as defined by the CORS W3C recommendation. Note that when input CorsConfiguration is null, this implementation does not reject simple or actual requests outright but simply avoid adding CORS headers to the response. CORS processing is also skipped if the response already contains CORS headers, or if the request is detected as a same-origin one.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/cors/DefaultCorsProcessor.html
UrlBasedCorsConfigurationSource	A										<section class="prog__container">Provide a per request CorsConfiguration instance based on a collection of CorsConfiguration mapped on path patterns. Exact path mapping URIs (such as "/admin") are supported as well as Ant-style path patterns (such as "/admin/**").</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/cors/UrlBasedCorsConfigurationSource.html
AbstractRequestLoggingFilter	A										<section class="prog__container">Base class for Filters that perform logging operations before and after a request is processed. Subclasses should override the beforeRequest(HttpServletRequest, String) and afterRequest(HttpServletRequest, String) methods to perform the actual logging around the request. Subclasses are passed the message to write to the log in the beforeRequest and afterRequest methods. By default, only the URI of the request is logged. However, setting the includeQueryString property to true will cause the query string of the request to be included also. The payload (body) of the request can be logged via the includePayload flag. Note that this will only log that which is read, which might not be the entire payload. Prefixes and suffixes for the before and after messages can be configured using the beforeMessagePrefix, afterMessagePrefix, beforeMessageSuffix and afterMessageSuffix properties.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/filter/AbstractRequestLoggingFilter.html
CharacterEncodingFilter	A										<section class="prog__container">Servlet Filter that allows one to specify a character encoding for requests. This is useful because current browsers typically do not set a character encoding even if specified in the HTML page or form. This filter can either apply its encoding if the request does not already specify an encoding, or enforce this filter's encoding in any case ("forceEncoding"="true"). In the latter case, the encoding will also be applied as default response encoding (although this will usually be overridden by a full content type set in the view).</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/filter/CharacterEncodingFilter.html
CommonsRequestLoggingFilter	A										<section class="prog__container">Simple request logging filter that writes the request URI (and optionally the query string) to the Commons Log.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/filter/CommonsRequestLoggingFilter.html
CompositeFilter	A										<section class="prog__container">A generic composite servlet Filter that just delegates its behavior to a chain (list) of user-supplied filters, achieving the functionality of a FilterChain, but conveniently using only Filter instances. This is useful for filters that require dependency injection, and can therefore be set up in a Spring application context. Typically, this composite would be used in conjunction with DelegatingFilterProxy, so that it can be declared in Spring but applied to a servlet context.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/filter/CompositeFilter.html
CorsFilter	A										<section class="prog__container">Filter that handles CORS preflight requests and intercepts CORS simple and actual requests thanks to a CorsProcessor implementation (DefaultCorsProcessor by default) in order to add the relevant CORS response headers (like Access-Control-Allow-Origin) using the provided CorsConfigurationSource (for example an UrlBasedCorsConfigurationSource instance. This is an alternative to Spring MVC Java config and XML namespace CORS configuration, useful for applications depending only on spring-web (not on spring-webmvc) or for security constraints requiring CORS checks to be performed at Filter level. This filter could be used in conjunction with DelegatingFilterProxy in order to help with its initialization.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/filter/CorsFilter.html
DelegatingFilterProxy	A										<section class="prog__container">Proxy for a standard Servlet Filter, delegating to a Spring-managed bean that implements the Filter interface. Supports a "targetBeanName" filter init-param in web.xml, specifying the name of the target bean in the Spring application context. web.xml will usually contain a DelegatingFilterProxy definition, with the specified filter-name corresponding to a bean name in Spring's root application context. All calls to the filter proxy will then be delegated to that bean in the Spring context, which is required to implement the standard Servlet Filter interface. This approach is particularly useful for Filter implementation with complex setup needs, allowing to apply the full Spring bean definition machinery to Filter instances. Alternatively, consider standard Filter setup in combination with looking up service beans from the Spring root application context. NOTE: The lifecycle methods defined by the Servlet Filter interface will by default not be delegated to the target bean, relying on the Spring application context to manage the lifecycle of that bean. Specifying the "targetFilterLifecycle" filter init-param as "true" will enforce invocation of the Filter.init and Filter.destroy lifecycle methods on the target bean, letting the servlet container manage the filter lifecycle. As of Spring 3.1, DelegatingFilterProxy has been updated to optionally accept constructor parameters when using Servlet 3.0's instance-based filter registration methods, usually in conjunction with Spring 3.1's WebApplicationInitializer SPI. These constructors allow for providing the delegate Filter bean directly, or providing the application context and bean name to fetch, avoiding the need to look up the application context from the ServletContext. This class was originally inspired by Spring Security's FilterToBeanProxy class, written by Ben Alex.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/filter/DelegatingFilterProxy.html
ForwardedHeaderFilter	A										<section class="prog__container">Filter that wraps the request in order to override its getServerName(), getServerPort(), getScheme(), and isSecure() methods with values derived from "Forwarded" or "X-Forwarded-*" headers. In effect the wrapped request reflects the client-originated protocol and address.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/filter/ForwardedHeaderFilter.html
GenericFilterBean	A										<section class="prog__container">Simple base implementation of Filter which treats its config parameters (init-param entries within the filter tag in web.xml) as bean properties. A handy superclass for any type of filter. Type conversion of config parameters is automatic, with the corresponding setter method getting invoked with the converted value. It is also possible for subclasses to specify required properties. Parameters without matching bean property setter will simply be ignored. This filter leaves actual filtering to subclasses, which have to implement the Filter.doFilter(javax.servlet.ServletRequest, javax.servlet.ServletResponse, javax.servlet.FilterChain) method. This generic filter base class has no dependency on the Spring ApplicationContext concept. Filters usually don't load their own context but rather access service beans from the Spring root application context, accessible via the filter's ServletContext (see WebApplicationContextUtils).</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/filter/GenericFilterBean.html
HiddenHttpMethodFilter	A										<section class="prog__container">Filter that converts posted method parameters into HTTP methods, retrievable via HttpServletRequest.getMethod(). Since browsers currently only support GET and POST, a common technique - used by the Prototype library, for instance - is to use a normal POST with an additional hidden form field (_method) to pass the "real" HTTP method along. This filter reads that parameter and changes the HttpServletRequestWrapper.getMethod() return value accordingly. The name of the request parameter defaults to _method, but can be adapted via the methodParam property. NOTE: This filter needs to run after multipart processing in case of a multipart POST request, due to its inherent need for checking a POST body parameter. So typically, put a Spring MultipartFilterbefore this HiddenHttpMethodFilter in your web.xml filter chain.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/filter/HiddenHttpMethodFilter.html
HttpPutFormContentFilter	A										<section class="prog__container">Filter that makes form encoded data available through the ServletRequest.getParameter*() family of methods during HTTP PUT or PATCH requests. The Servlet spec requires form data to be available for HTTP POST but not for HTTP PUT or PATCH requests. This filter intercepts HTTP PUT and PATCH requests where content type is 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded', reads form encoded content from the body of the request, and wraps the ServletRequest in order to make the form data available as request parameters just like it is for HTTP POST requests.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/filter/HttpPutFormContentFilter.html
Log4jNestedDiagnosticContextFilter	A										<section class="prog__container">Deprecated. as of Spring 4.2.1, in favor of Apache Log4j 2 (following Apache's EOL declaration for log4j 1.x)</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/filter/Log4jNestedDiagnosticContextFilter.html
OncePerRequestFilter	A										<section class="prog__container">Filter base class that aims to guarantee a single execution per request dispatch, on any servlet container. It provides a doFilterInternal(javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest, javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse, javax.servlet.FilterChain) method with HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse arguments. As of Servlet 3.0, a filter may be invoked as part of a REQUEST or ASYNC dispatches that occur in separate threads. A filter can be configured in web.xml whether it should be involved in async dispatches. However, in some cases servlet containers assume different default configuration. Therefore sub-classes can override the method shouldNotFilterAsyncDispatch() to declare statically if they should indeed be invoked, once, during both types of dispatches in order to provide thread initialization, logging, security, and so on. This mechanism complements and does not replace the need to configure a filter in web.xml with dispatcher types. Subclasses may use isAsyncDispatch(HttpServletRequest) to determine when a filter is invoked as part of an async dispatch, and use isAsyncStarted(HttpServletRequest) to determine when the request has been placed in async mode and therefore the current dispatch won't be the last one for the given request. Yet another dispatch type that also occurs in its own thread is ERROR. Subclasses can override shouldNotFilterErrorDispatch() if they wish to declare statically if they should be invoked once during error dispatches. The getAlreadyFilteredAttributeName() method determines how to identify that a request is already filtered. The default implementation is based on the configured name of the concrete filter instance.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/filter/OncePerRequestFilter.html
RequestContextFilter	A										<section class="prog__container">Servlet Filter that exposes the request to the current thread, through both LocaleContextHolder and RequestContextHolder. To be registered as filter in web.xml. Alternatively, Spring's RequestContextListener and Spring's DispatcherServlet also expose the same request context to the current thread. This filter is mainly for use with third-party servlets, e.g. the JSF FacesServlet. Within Spring's own web support, DispatcherServlet's processing is perfectly sufficient.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/filter/RequestContextFilter.html
ServletContextRequestLoggingFilter	A										<section class="prog__container">Simple request logging filter that writes the request URI (and optionally the query string) to the ServletContext log.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/filter/ServletContextRequestLoggingFilter.html
ShallowEtagHeaderFilter	A										<section class="prog__container">Filter that generates an ETag value based on the content on the response. This ETag is compared to the If-None-Match header of the request. If these headers are equal, the response content is not sent, but rather a 304 "Not Modified" status instead. Since the ETag is based on the response content, the response (e.g. a View) is still rendered. As such, this filter only saves bandwidth, not server performance.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/filter/ShallowEtagHeaderFilter.html
DecoratingNavigationHandler	A										<section class="prog__container">Base class for JSF NavigationHandler implementations that want to be capable of decorating an original NavigationHandler. Supports the standard JSF style of decoration (through a constructor argument) as well as an overloaded handleNavigation method with explicit NavigationHandler argument (passing in the original NavigationHandler). Subclasses are forced to implement this overloaded handleNavigation method. Standard JSF invocations will automatically delegate to the overloaded method, with the constructor-injected NavigationHandler as argument.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/jsf/DecoratingNavigationHandler.html
DelegatingNavigationHandlerProxy	A										<section class="prog__container">JSF NavigationHandler implementation that delegates to a NavigationHandler bean obtained from the Spring root WebApplicationContext. Configure this handler proxy in your faces-config.xml file as follows:  <application>   ...   <navigation-handler>           org.springframework.web.jsf.DelegatingNavigationHandlerProxy   </navigation-handler>   ... </application> By default, the Spring ApplicationContext will be searched for the NavigationHandler under the bean name "jsfNavigationHandler". In the simplest case, this is a plain Spring bean definition like the following. However, all of Spring's bean configuration power can be applied to such a bean, in particular all flavors of dependency injection.  <bean name="jsfNavigationHandler" class="mypackage.MyNavigationHandler">   <property name="myProperty" ref="myOtherBean"/> </bean> The target NavigationHandler bean will typically extend the standard JSF NavigationHandler class. However, note that decorating the original NavigationHandler (the JSF provider's default handler) is not supported in such a scenario, since we can't inject the original handler in standard JSF style (that is, as constructor argument). For decorating the original NavigationHandler, make sure that your target bean extends Spring's DecoratingNavigationHandler class. This allows to pass in the original handler as method argument, which this proxy automatically detects. Note that a DecoratingNavigationHandler subclass will still work as standard JSF NavigationHandler as well! This proxy may be subclassed to change the bean name used to search for the navigation handler, change the strategy used to obtain the target handler, or change the strategy used to access the ApplicationContext (normally obtained via FacesContextUtils.getWebApplicationContext(FacesContext)).</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/jsf/DelegatingNavigationHandlerProxy.html
DelegatingPhaseListenerMulticaster	A										<section class="prog__container">JSF PhaseListener implementation that delegates to one or more Spring-managed PhaseListener beans coming from the Spring root WebApplicationContext. Configure this listener multicaster in your faces-config.xml file as follows:  <application>   ...   <phase-listener>     org.springframework.web.jsf.DelegatingPhaseListenerMulticaster   </phase-listener>   ... </application> The multicaster will delegate all beforePhase and afterPhase events to all target PhaseListener beans. By default, those will simply be obtained by type: All beans in the Spring root WebApplicationContext that implement the PhaseListener interface will be fetched and invoked. Note: This multicaster's getPhaseId() method will always return ANY_PHASE. The phase id exposed by the target listener beans will be ignored; all events will be propagated to all listeners.This multicaster may be subclassed to change the strategy used to obtain the listener beans, or to change the strategy used to access the ApplicationContext (normally obtained via FacesContextUtils.getWebApplicationContext(FacesContext)).</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/jsf/DelegatingPhaseListenerMulticaster.html
FacesContextUtils	A										<section class="prog__container">Convenience methods to retrieve Spring's root WebApplicationContext for a given JSF FacesContext. This is useful for accessing a Spring application context from custom JSF-based code. Analogous to Spring's WebApplicationContextUtils for the ServletContext.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/jsf/FacesContextUtils.html
SpringBeanFacesELResolver	A										<section class="prog__container">JSF ELResolver that delegates to the Spring root WebApplicationContext, resolving name references to Spring-defined beans. Configure this resolver in your faces-config.xml file as follows:  <application>   ...   <el-resolver>org.springframework.web.jsf.el.SpringBeanFacesELResolver</el-resolver> </application> All your JSF expressions can then implicitly refer to the names of Spring-managed service layer beans, for example in property values of JSF-managed beans:  <managed-bean>   <managed-bean-name>myJsfManagedBean</managed-bean-name>   <managed-bean-class>example.MyJsfManagedBean</managed-bean-class>   <managed-bean-scope>session</managed-bean-scope>   <managed-property>     <property-name>mySpringManagedBusinessObject</property-name>     <value>#{mySpringManagedBusinessObject}</value>   </managed-property> </managed-bean> with "mySpringManagedBusinessObject" defined as Spring bean in applicationContext.xml:  <bean id="mySpringManagedBusinessObject" class="example.MySpringManagedBusinessObject">   ... </bean></section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/jsf/el/SpringBeanFacesELResolver.html
WebApplicationContextFacesELResolver	A										<section class="prog__container">Special JSF ELResolver that exposes the Spring WebApplicationContext instance under a variable named "webApplicationContext". In contrast to SpringBeanFacesELResolver, this ELResolver variant does not resolve JSF variable names as Spring bean names. It rather exposes Spring's root WebApplicationContext itself under a special name, and is able to resolve "webApplicationContext.mySpringManagedBusinessObject" dereferences to Spring-defined beans in that application context. Configure this resolver in your faces-config.xml file as follows:  <application>   ...   <el-resolver>org.springframework.web.jsf.el.WebApplicationContextFacesELResolver</el-resolver> </application></section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/jsf/el/WebApplicationContextFacesELResolver.html
ControllerAdviceBean	A										<section class="prog__container">Encapsulates information about an @ControllerAdvice Spring-managed bean without necessarily requiring it to be instantiated. The findAnnotatedBeans(ApplicationContext) method can be used to discover such beans. However, a ControllerAdviceBean may be created from any object, including ones without an @ControllerAdvice.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/method/ControllerAdviceBean.html
HandlerMethod.HandlerMethodParameter	A										<section class="prog__container">A MethodParameter with HandlerMethod-specific behavior.</section>	No URL found
HandlerMethod	A										<section class="prog__container">Encapsulates information about a handler method consisting of a method and a bean. Provides convenient access to method parameters, the method return value, method annotations, etc. The class may be created with a bean instance or with a bean name (e.g. lazy-init bean, prototype bean). Use createWithResolvedBean() to obtain a HandlerMethod instance with a bean instance resolved through the associated BeanFactory.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/method/HandlerMethod.html
HandlerMethodSelector	A										<section class="prog__container">Deprecated. as of Spring 4.2.3, in favor of the generalized and refined MethodIntrospector</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/method/HandlerMethodSelector.html
AbstractCookieValueMethodArgumentResolver	A										<section class="prog__container">A base abstract class to resolve method arguments annotated with @CookieValue. Subclasses extract the cookie value from the request. An @CookieValue is a named value that is resolved from a cookie. It has a required flag and a default value to fall back on when the cookie does not exist. A WebDataBinder may be invoked to apply type conversion to the resolved cookie value.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/method/annotation/AbstractCookieValueMethodArgumentResolver.html
AbstractNamedValueMethodArgumentResolver	A										<section class="prog__container">Abstract base class for resolving method arguments from a named value. Request parameters, request headers, and path variables are examples of named values. Each may have a name, a required flag, and a default value. Subclasses define how to do the following: Obtain named value information for a method parameter Resolve names into argument values Handle missing argument values when argument values are required Optionally handle a resolved value A default value string can contain ${...} placeholders and Spring Expression Language #{...} expressions. For this to work a ConfigurableBeanFactory must be supplied to the class constructor. A WebDataBinder is created to apply type conversion to the resolved argument value if it doesn't match the method parameter type.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/method/annotation/AbstractNamedValueMethodArgumentResolver.html

AbstractWebArgumentResolverAdapter	A										<section class="prog__container">An abstract base class adapting a WebArgumentResolver to the HandlerMethodArgumentResolver contract. Note: This class is provided for backwards compatibility. However it is recommended to re-write a WebArgumentResolver as HandlerMethodArgumentResolver. Since supportsParameter(org.springframework.core.MethodParameter) can only be implemented by actually resolving the value and then checking the result is not WebArgumentResolver#UNRESOLVED any exceptions raised must be absorbed and ignored since it's not clear whether the adapter doesn't support the parameter or whether it failed for an internal reason. The HandlerMethodArgumentResolver contract also provides access to model attributes and to WebDataBinderFactory (for type conversion).</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/method/annotation/AbstractWebArgumentResolverAdapter.html
ErrorsMethodArgumentResolver	A										<section class="prog__container">Resolves Errors method arguments.

Model attributes are obtained from the model or created with a default constructor (and then added to the model). Once created the attribute is populated via data binding to Servlet request parameters. Validation may be applied if the argument is annotated with @javax.validation.Valid. or Spring's own @org.springframework.validation.annotation.Validated. When this handler is created with annotationNotRequired=true any non-simple type argument and return value is regarded as a model attribute with or without the presence of an @ModelAttribute.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/method/annotation/ModelAttributeMethodProcessor.html
ModelFactory	A										<section class="prog__container">Assist with initialization of the Model before controller method invocation and with updates to it after the invocation. On initialization the model is populated with attributes temporarily stored in the session and through the invocation of @ModelAttribute methods.

RequestHeaderMethodArgumentResolver	A										<section class="prog__container">Resolves method arguments annotated with @RequestHeader except for Map arguments. See RequestHeaderMapMethodArgumentResolver for details on Map arguments annotated with @RequestHeader. An @RequestHeader is a named value resolved from a request header. It has a required flag and a default value to fall back on when the request header does not exist. A WebDataBinder is invoked to apply type conversion to resolved request header values that don't yet match the method parameter type.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/method/annotation/RequestHeaderMethodArgumentResolver.html
RequestParamMapMethodArgumentResolver	A										<section class="prog__container">Resolves Map method arguments annotated with an @RequestParam where the annotation does not specify a request parameter name.

RequestParamMethodArgumentResolver	A										<section class="prog__container">Resolves method arguments annotated with @RequestParam, arguments of type MultipartFile in conjunction with Spring's MultipartResolver abstraction, and arguments of type javax.servlet.http.Part in conjunction with Servlet 3.0 multipart requests. This resolver can also be created in default resolution mode in which simple types (int, long, etc.) not annotated with @RequestParam are also treated as request parameters with the parameter name derived from the argument name. If the method parameter type is Map, the name specified in the annotation is used to resolve the request parameter String value. The value is then converted to a Map via type conversion assuming a suitable Converter or PropertyEditor has been registered. Or if a request parameter name is not specified the RequestParamMapMethodArgumentResolver is used instead to provide access to all request parameters in the form of a map. A WebDataBinder is invoked to apply type conversion to resolved request header values that don't yet match the method parameter type.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/method/annotation/RequestParamMethodArgumentResolver.html

MultipartResolver	A										<section class="prog__container">A strategy interface for multipart file upload resolution in accordance with RFC 1867. Implementations are typically usable both within an application context and standalone. There are two concrete implementations included in Spring, as of Spring 3.1: CommonsMultipartResolver for Apache Commons FileUpload StandardServletMultipartResolver for the Servlet 3.0+ Part API There is no default resolver implementation used for Spring DispatcherServlets, as an application might choose to parse its multipart requests itself. To define an implementation, create a bean with the id "multipartResolver" in a DispatcherServlet's application context. Such a resolver gets applied to all requests handled by that DispatcherServlet. If a DispatcherServlet detects a multipart request, it will resolve it via the configured MultipartResolver and pass on a wrapped HttpServletRequest. Controllers can then cast their given request to the MultipartHttpServletRequest interface, which allows for access to any MultipartFiles. Note that this cast is only supported in case of an actual multipart request.  public ModelAndView handleRequest(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) {   MultipartHttpServletRequest multipartRequest = (MultipartHttpServletRequest) request;   MultipartFile multipartFile = multipartRequest.getFile("image");   ... } Instead of direct access, command or form controllers can register a ByteArrayMultipartFileEditor or StringMultipartFileEditor with their data binder, to automatically apply multipart content to form bean properties. As an alternative to using a MultipartResolver with a DispatcherServlet, a MultipartFilter can be registered in web.xml. It will delegate to a corresponding MultipartResolver bean in the root application context. This is mainly intended for applications that do not use Spring's own web MVC framework. Note: There is hardly ever a need to access the MultipartResolver itself from application code. It will simply do its work behind the scenes, making MultipartHttpServletRequests available to controllers.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/multipart/MultipartResolver.html
CommonsFileUploadSupport	A										<section class="prog__container">Base class for multipart resolvers that use Apache Commons FileUpload 1.2 or above. Provides common configuration properties and parsing functionality for multipart requests, using a Map of Spring CommonsMultipartFile instances as representation of uploaded files and a String-based parameter Map as representation of uploaded form fields.

MultipartFilter	A										<section class="prog__container">Servlet Filter that resolves multipart requests via a MultipartResolver. in the root web application context. Looks up the MultipartResolver in Spring's root web application context. Supports a "multipartResolverBeanName" filter init-param in web.xml; the default bean name is "filterMultipartResolver". If no MultipartResolver bean is found, this filter falls back to a default MultipartResolver: StandardServletMultipartResolver for Servlet 3.0, based on a multipart-config section in web.xml. Note however that at present the Servlet specification only defines how to enable multipart configuration on a Servlet and as a result multipart request processing is likely not possible in a Filter unless the Servlet container provides a workaround such as Tomcat's "allowCasualMultipartParsing" property. MultipartResolver lookup is customizable: Override this filter's lookupMultipartResolver method to use a custom MultipartResolver instance, for example if not using a Spring web application context. Note that the lookup method should not create a new MultipartResolver instance for each call but rather return a reference to a pre-built instance. Note: This filter is an alternative to using DispatcherServlet's MultipartResolver support, for example for web applications with custom web views which do not use Spring's web MVC, or for custom filters applied before a Spring MVC DispatcherServlet (e.g. HiddenHttpMethodFilter). In any case, this filter should not be combined with servlet-specific multipart resolution.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/multipart/support/MultipartFilter.html

StandardServletMultipartResolver	A										<section class="prog__container">Standard implementation of the MultipartResolver interface, based on the Servlet 3.0 Part API. To be added as "multipartResolver" bean to a Spring DispatcherServlet context, without any extra configuration at the bean level (see below). Note: In order to use Servlet 3.0 based multipart parsing, you need to mark the affected servlet with a "multipart-config" section in web.xml, or with a MultipartConfigElement in programmatic servlet registration, or (in case of a custom servlet class) possibly with a MultipartConfig annotation on your servlet class. Configuration settings such as maximum sizes or storage locations need to be applied at that servlet registration level; Servlet 3.0 does not allow for them to be set at the MultipartResolver level.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/multipart/support/StandardServletMultipartResolver.html

DispatcherPortlet	A										<section class="prog__container">Central dispatcher for use within the Portlet MVC framework, e.g. for web UI controllers. Dispatches to registered handlers for processing a portlet request. This portlet is very flexible: It can be used with just about any workflow, with the installation of the appropriate adapter classes. It offers the following functionality that distinguishes it from other request-driven Portlet MVC frameworks: It is based around a JavaBeans configuration mechanism. It can use any HandlerMapping implementation - pre-built or provided as part of an application - to control the routing of requests to handler objects. Default is a DefaultAnnotationHandlerMapping. HandlerMapping objects can be defined as beans in the portlet's application context, implementing the HandlerMapping interface, overriding the default HandlerMapping if present. HandlerMappings can be given any bean name (they are tested by type). It can use any HandlerAdapter; this allows for using any handler interface. The default adapter is SimpleControllerHandlerAdapter for Spring's Controller interface. A default AnnotationMethodHandlerAdapter will be registered as well. HandlerAdapter objects can be added as beans in the application context, overriding the default HandlerAdapter. Like HandlerMappings, HandlerAdapters can be given any bean name (they are tested by type). The dispatcher's exception resolution strategy can be specified via a HandlerExceptionResolver, for example mapping certain exceptions to error pages. Default is none. Additional HandlerExceptionResolvers can be added through the application context. HandlerExceptionResolver can be given any bean name (they are tested by type). Its view resolution strategy can be specified via a ViewResolver implementation, resolving symbolic view names into View objects. Default is InternalResourceViewResolver. ViewResolver objects can be added as beans in the application context, overriding the default ViewResolver. ViewResolvers can be given any bean name (they are tested by type). The dispatcher's strategy for resolving multipart requests is determined by a PortletMultipartResolver implementation. An implementations for Apache Commons FileUpload is included: CommonsPortletMultipartResolver. The MultipartResolver bean name is "portletMultipartResolver"; default is none. NOTE: The @RequestMapping annotation will only be processed if a corresponding HandlerMapping (for type-level annotations) and/or HandlerAdapter (for method-level annotations) is present in the dispatcher. This is the case by default. However, if you are defining custom HandlerMappings or HandlerAdapters, then you need to make sure that a corresponding custom DefaultAnnotationHandlerMapping and/or AnnotationMethodHandlerAdapter is defined as well - provided that you intend to use @RequestMapping. A web application can define any number of DispatcherPortlets. Each portlet will operate in its own namespace, loading its own application context with mappings, handlers, etc. Only the root application context as loaded by ContextLoaderListener, if any, will be shared. Thanks to Rainer Schmitz, Nick Lothian and Eric Dalquist for their suggestions!</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/portlet/DispatcherPortlet.html
FrameworkPortlet	A										<section class="prog__container">Base portlet for Spring's portlet framework. Provides integration with a Spring application context, in a JavaBean-based overall solution. This class offers the following functionality: Manages a Portlet ApplicationContext instance per portlet. The portlet's configuration is determined by beans in the portlet's namespace. Publishes events on request processing, whether or not a request is successfully handled. Subclasses must implement doActionService(javax.portlet.ActionRequest, javax.portlet.ActionResponse) and doRenderService(javax.portlet.RenderRequest, javax.portlet.RenderResponse) to handle action and render requests. Because this extends GenericPortletBean rather than Portlet directly, bean properties are mapped onto it. Subclasses can override initFrameworkPortlet() for custom initialization. Regards a "contextClass" parameter at the portlet init-param level, falling back to the default context class (XmlPortletApplicationContext) if not found. Note that, with the default FrameworkPortlet, a context class needs to implement the ConfigurablePortletApplicationContext SPI. Passes a "contextConfigLocation" portlet init-param to the context instance, parsing it into potentially multiple file paths which can be separated by any number of commas and spaces, like "test-portlet.xml, myPortlet.xml". If not explicitly specified, the context implementation is supposed to build a default location from the namespace of the portlet. Note: In case of multiple config locations, later bean definitions will override ones defined in earlier loaded files, at least when using one of Spring's default ApplicationContext implementations. This can be leveraged to deliberately override certain bean definitions via an extra XML file. The default namespace is "'portlet-name'-portlet", e.g. "test-portlet" for a portlet-name "test" (leading to a "/WEB-INF/test-portlet.xml" default location with XmlPortletApplicationContext). The namespace can also be set explicitly via the "namespace" portlet init-param.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/portlet/FrameworkPortlet.html
GenericPortletBean	A										<section class="prog__container">Simple extension of javax.portlet.GenericPortlet that treats its config parameters as bean properties. A very handy superclass for any type of portlet. Type conversion is automatic. It is also possible for subclasses to specify required properties. This portlet leaves request handling to subclasses, inheriting the default behaviour of GenericPortlet (doDispatch, processAction, etc). This portlet superclass has no dependency on a Spring application context, in contrast to the FrameworkPortlet class which loads its own context.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/portlet/GenericPortletBean.html
HandlerAdapter	A										<section class="prog__container">Portlet MVC framework SPI interface, allowing parameterization of core MVC workflow. Interface that must be implemented for each handler type to handle a request. This interface is used to allow the DispatcherPortlet to be indefinitely extensible. The DispatcherPortlet accesses all installed handlers through this interface, meaning that it does not contain code specific to any handler type. Note that a handler can be of type Object. This is to enable handlers from other frameworks to be integrated with this framework without custom coding. This interface is not intended for application developers. It is available to handlers who want to develop their own web workflow. Note: Implementations can implement the Ordered interface to be able to specify a sorting order and thus a priority for getting applied by DispatcherPortlet. Non-Ordered instances get treated as lowest priority.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/portlet/HandlerAdapter.html
HandlerExceptionResolver	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface to be implemented by objects than can resolve exceptions thrown during handler mapping or execution, in the typical case to error views. Implementors are typically registered as beans in the application context. Error views are analogous to the error page JSPs, but can be used with any kind of exception including any checked exception, with potentially fine-granular mappings for specific handlers.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/portlet/HandlerExceptionResolver.html
HandlerExecutionChain	A										<section class="prog__container">Handler execution chain, consisting of handler object and any handler interceptors. Returned by HandlerMapping's HandlerMapping.getHandler(javax.portlet.PortletRequest) method.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/portlet/HandlerExecutionChain.html
HandlerInterceptor	A										<section class="prog__container">Workflow interface that allows for customized handler execution chains. Applications can register any number of existing or custom interceptors for certain groups of handlers, to add common pre-processing behavior without needing to modify each handler implementation. A HandlerInterceptor gets called before the appropriate HandlerAdapter triggers the execution of the handler itself. This mechanism can be used for a large field of preprocessing aspects, e.g. for authorization checks, or common handler behavior like locale or theme changes. Its main purpose is to permit the factoring out of otherwise repetitive handler code. Typically an interceptor chain is defined per HandlerMapping bean, sharing its granularity. To be able to apply a certain interceptor chain to a group of handlers, one needs to map the desired handlers via one HandlerMapping bean. The interceptors themselves are defined as beans in the application context, referenced by the mapping bean definition via its "interceptors" property (in XML: a <list> of <ref> elements). A HandlerInterceptor is basically similar to a Servlet Filter, but in contrast to the latter it allows custom pre-processing with the option to prohibit the execution of the handler itself, and custom post-processing. Filters are more powerful; for example they allow for exchanging the request and response objects that are handed down the chain. Note that a filter gets configured in web.xml, a HandlerInterceptor in the application context. As a basic guideline, fine-grained handler-related pre-processing tasks are candidates for HandlerInterceptor implementations, especially factored-out common handler code and authorization checks. On the other hand, a Filter is well-suited for request content and view content handling, like multipart forms and GZIP compression. This typically shows when one needs to map the filter to certain content types (e.g. images), or to all requests. Be aware that filters cannot be applied to portlet requests (they only operate on servlet requests), so for portlet requests interceptors are essential. If we assume a "sunny day" request cycle (i.e. a request where nothing goes wrong and all is well), the workflow of a HandlerInterceptor will be as follows: Action Request:DispatcherPortlet maps the action request to a particular handler and assembles a handler execution chain consisting of the handler that is to be invoked and all of the HandlerInterceptor instances that apply to the request.preHandleAction(..) is called; if the invocation of this method returns true then this workflow continues.The target handler handles the action request (via HandlerAdapter.handleAction(..)).afterActionCompletion(..) is called.Render Request:DispatcherPortlet maps the render request to a particular handler and assembles a handler execution chain consisting of the handler that is to be invoked and all of the HandlerInterceptor instances that apply to the request.preHandleRender(..) is called; if the invocation of this method returns true then this workflow continues.The target handler handles the render request (via HandlerAdapter.handleRender(..)).postHandleRender(..) is called.If the HandlerAdapter returned a ModelAndView, then DispatcherPortlet renders the view accordingly. afterRenderCompletion(..) is called.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/portlet/HandlerInterceptor.html
HandlerMapping	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface to be implemented by objects that define a mapping between requests and handler objects. This class can be implemented by application developers, although this is not necessary, as PortletModeHandlerMapping, ParameterHandlerMapping and PortletModeParameterHandlerMapping are included in the framework. The first is the default if no HandlerMapping bean is registered in the portlet application context. HandlerMapping implementations can support mapped interceptors but do not have to. A handler will always be wrapped in a HandlerExecutionChain instance, optionally accompanied by some HandlerInterceptor instances. The DispatcherPortlet will first call each HandlerInterceptor's preHandle method in the given order, finally invoking the handler itself if all preHandle methods have returned true. The ability to parameterize this mapping is a powerful and unusual capability of this Portlet MVC framework. For example, it is possible to write a custom mapping based on session state, cookie state or many other variables. No other MVC framework seems to be equally flexible. Note: Implementations can implement the Ordered interface to be able to specify a sorting order and thus a priority for getting applied by DispatcherPortlet. Non-Ordered instances get treated as lowest priority.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/portlet/HandlerMapping.html
ModelAndView	A										<section class="prog__container">Holder for both Model and View in the web MVC framework. Note that these are entirely distinct. This class merely holds both to make it possible for a controller to return both model and view in a single return value. Represents a model and view returned by a handler, to be resolved by a DispatcherPortlet. The view can take the form of a String view name which will need to be resolved by a ViewResolver object; alternatively a view object can be specified directly. The model is a Map, allowing the use of multiple objects keyed by name.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/portlet/ModelAndView.html
ModelAndViewDefiningException	A										<section class="prog__container">Exception to be thrown on error conditions that should forward to a specific view with a specific model.

See the DataBinder/WebDataBinder superclasses for customization options, which include specifying allowed/required fields, and registering custom property editors. Can also be used for manual data binding in custom web controllers: for example, in a plain Portlet Controller implementation. Simply instantiate a PortletRequestDataBinder for each binding process, and invoke bind with the current PortletRequest as argument:  MyBean myBean = new MyBean(); // apply binder to custom target object PortletRequestDataBinder binder = new PortletRequestDataBinder(myBean); // register custom editors, if desired binder.registerCustomEditor(...); // trigger actual binding of request parameters binder.bind(request); // optionally evaluate binding errors Errors errors = binder.getErrors(); ...</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/portlet/bind/PortletRequestDataBinder.html
PortletRequestParameterPropertyValues	A										<section class="prog__container">PropertyValues implementation created from parameters in a PortletRequest. Can look for all property values beginning with a certain prefix and prefix separator (default is "_"). For example, with a prefix of "spring", "spring_param1" and "spring_param2" result in a Map with "param1" and "param2" as keys.

AbstractRefreshablePortletApplicationContext	A										<section class="prog__container">AbstractRefreshableApplicationContext subclass which implements the ConfigurablePortletApplicationContext interface for portlet environments. Provides a "configLocations" property, to be populated through the ConfigurablePortletApplicationContext interface on portlet application startup. This class is as easy to subclass as AbstractRefreshableApplicationContext: All you need to implements is the AbstractRefreshableApplicationContext.loadBeanDefinitions(org.springframework.beans.factory.support.DefaultListableBeanFactory) method; see the superclass javadoc for details. Note that implementations are supposed to load bean definitions from the files specified by the locations returned by the getConfigLocations() method. Interprets resource paths as servlet context resources, i.e. as paths beneath the web application root. Absolute paths, e.g. for files outside the web app root, can be accessed via "file:" URLs, as implemented by DefaultResourceLoader. This is the portlet context to be subclassed for a different bean definition format. Such a context implementation can be specified as "contextClass" init-param for FrameworkPortlet, replacing the default XmlPortletApplicationContext. It will then automatically receive the "contextConfigLocation" init-param. Note that Portlet-based context implementations are generally supposed to configure themselves based on the configuration received through the ConfigurablePortletApplicationContext interface. In contrast, a standalone application context might allow for configuration in custom startup code (for example, GenericApplicationContext).</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/portlet/context/AbstractRefreshablePortletApplicationContext.html
ConfigurablePortletApplicationContext	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface to be implemented by configurable portlet application contexts. Supported by FrameworkPortlet.

PortletContextScope	A										<section class="prog__container">Scope wrapper for a PortletContext, i.e. for global web application attributes. This differs from traditional Spring singletons in that it exposes attributes in the PortletContext. Those attributes will get destroyed whenever the entire application shuts down, which might be earlier or later than the shutdown of the containing Spring ApplicationContext. The associated destruction mechanism relies on a ContextCleanupListener being registered in web.xml. Note that ContextLoaderListener includes ContextCleanupListener's functionality.

XmlPortletApplicationContext	A										<section class="prog__container">Portlet-based WebApplicationContext implementation which takes its configuration from XML documents, understood by an XmlBeanDefinitionReader. This is essentially the equivalent of AbstractXmlApplicationContext for a portlet environment. By default, the configuration will be taken from "/WEB-INF/applicationContext.xml" for the root context, and "/WEB-INF/test-portlet.xml" for a context with the namespace "test-portlet" (like for a DispatcherPortlet instance with the portlet-name "test"). The config location defaults can be overridden via the "contextConfigLocation" portlet init-param of FrameworkPortlet. Config locations can either denote concrete files like "/WEB-INF/context.xml" or Ant-style patterns like "/WEB-INF/*-context.xml" (see PathMatcher javadoc for pattern details). Note: In case of multiple config locations, later bean definitions will override ones defined in earlier loaded files. This can be leveraged to deliberately override certain bean definitions via an extra XML file. For a Portlet-based context that reads in a different bean definition format, create an analogous subclass of AbstractRefreshablePortletApplicationContext. Such a context implementation can be specified as "contextClass" init-param for a FrameworkPortlet instance.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/portlet/context/XmlPortletApplicationContext.html

ParameterMappingInterceptor	A										<section class="prog__container">Interceptor to forward a request parameter from the ActionRequest to the RenderRequest. This can be useful when using ParameterHandlerMapping or PortletModeParameterHandlerMapping. It will ensure that the parameter that was used to map the ActionRequest to a handler will be forwarded to the RenderRequest so that it will also be mapped the same way. When using this Interceptor, you can still change the value of the mapping parameter in your handler in order to change where the render request will get mapped. Be aware that this Interceptor does call ActionResponse.setRenderParameter, which means that you will not be able to call ActionResponse.sendRedirect in your handler.  If you may need to issue a redirect, then you should avoid this Interceptor and either write a different one that does this in a different way, or manually forward the parameter from within your handler(s).

PortletModeParameterHandlerMapping	A										<section class="prog__container">Implementation of the HandlerMapping interface to map from the current PortletMode and a request parameter to request handler beans. The mapping consists of two levels: first the PortletMode and then the parameter value. In order to be mapped, both elements must match the mapping definition. This is a combination of the methods used in PortletModeHandlerMapping and ParameterHandlerMapping.  Unlike those two classes, this mapping cannot be initialized with properties since it requires a two-level map. The default name of the parameter is "action", but can be changed using setParameterName(). By default, the same parameter value may not be used in two different portlet modes.  This is so that if the portal itself changes the portlet mode, the request will no longer be valid in the mapping.  This behavior can be changed with setAllowDupParameters(). The bean configuration for this mapping will look somthing like this:  <bean id="portletModeParameterHandlerMapping" class="org.springframework.web.portlet.handler.PortletModeParameterHandlerMapping">   <property name="portletModeParameterMap">     <map>       <entry key="view"> <!-- portlet mode: view -->         <map>           <entry key="add"><ref bean="addItemHandler"/></entry>           <entry key="edit"><ref bean="editItemHandler"/></entry>           <entry key="delete"><ref bean="deleteItemHandler"/></entry>         </map>       </entry>       <entry key="edit"> <!-- portlet mode: edit -->         <map>           <entry key="prefs"><ref bean="preferencesHandler"/></entry>           <entry key="resetPrefs"><ref bean="resetPreferencesHandler"/></entry>         </map>       </entry>     </map>   </property> </bean>This mapping can be chained ahead of a PortletModeHandlerMapping, which can then provide defaults for each mode and an overall default as well.

SimplePortletHandlerAdapter	A										<section class="prog__container">Adapter to use the Portlet interface with the generic DispatcherPortlet. Calls the Portlet's render and processAction methods to handle a request. This adapter is not activated by default; it needs to be defined as a bean in the DispatcherPortlet context. It will automatically apply to mapped handler beans that implement the Portlet interface then. Note that Portlet instances defined as bean will not receive initialization and destruction callbacks, unless a special post-processor such as SimplePortletPostProcessor is defined in the DispatcherPortlet context. Alternatively, consider wrapping a Portlet with Spring's PortletWrappingController. This is particularly appropriate for existing Portlet classes, allowing to specify Portlet initialization parameters, etc.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/portlet/handler/SimplePortletHandlerAdapter.html
SimplePortletPostProcessor	A										<section class="prog__container">BeanPostProcessor that applies initialization and destruction callbacks to beans that implement the Portlet interface. After initialization of the bean instance, the Portlet init method will be called with a PortletConfig that contains the bean name of the Portlet and the PortletContext that it is running in. Before destruction of the bean instance, the Portlet destroy will be called. Note that this post-processor does not support Portlet initialization parameters. Bean instances that implement the Portlet interface are supposed to be configured like any other Spring bean, that is, through constructor arguments or bean properties. For reuse of a Portlet implementation in a plain Portlet container and as a bean in a Spring context, consider deriving from Spring's GenericPortletBean base class that applies Portlet initialization parameters as bean properties, supporting both the standard Portlet and the Spring bean initialization style. Alternatively, consider wrapping a Portlet with Spring's PortletWrappingController.

WebRequestHandlerInterceptorAdapter	A										<section class="prog__container">Adapter that implements the Portlet HandlerInterceptor interface and wraps an underlying WebRequestInterceptor. NOTE: The WebRequestInterceptor is by default only applied to the Portlet render phase, which is dealing with preparing and rendering a Portlet view. The Portlet action phase will only be intercepted with WebRequestInterceptor calls if the renderPhaseOnly flag is explicitly set to false. In general, it is recommended to use the Portlet-specific HandlerInterceptor mechanism for differentiating between action and render interception.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/portlet/handler/WebRequestHandlerInterceptorAdapter.html
CommonsPortletMultipartResolver	A										<section class="prog__container">PortletMultipartResolver implementation for Apache Commons FileUpload 1.2 or above.

MultipartActionRequest	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface which provides additional methods for dealing with multipart content within a portlet request, allowing to access uploaded files. Implementations also need to override the standard ActionRequest methods for parameter access, making multipart parameters available. A concrete implementation is DefaultMultipartActionRequest.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/portlet/multipart/MultipartActionRequest.html
PortletMultipartResolver	A										<section class="prog__container">Portlet version of Spring's multipart resolution strategy for file uploads as defined in RFC 1867. Implementations are typically usable both within any application context and standalone. There is one concrete implementation included in Spring: CommonsMultipartResolver for Apache Commons FileUpload There is no default resolver implementation used for Spring DispatcherPortlets, as an application might choose to parse its multipart requests itself. To define an implementation, create a bean with the id "portletMultipartResolver" in a DispatcherPortlet's application context. Such a resolver gets applied to all requests handled by that DispatcherPortlet. If a DispatcherPortlet detects a multipart request, it will resolve it via the configured PortletMultipartResolver and pass on a wrapped Portlet ActionRequest. Controllers can then cast their given request to the MultipartActionRequest interface, being able to access MultipartFiles. Note that this cast is only supported in case of an actual multipart request.  public void handleActionRequest(ActionRequest request, ActionResponse response) {   MultipartActionRequest multipartRequest = (MultipartActionRequest) request;   MultipartFile multipartFile = multipartRequest.getFile("image");   ... } Instead of direct access, command or form controllers can register a ByteArrayMultipartFileEditor or StringMultipartFileEditor with their data binder, to automatically apply multipart content to form bean properties. Note: There is hardly ever a need to access the MultipartResolver itself from application code. It will simply do its work behind the scenes, making MultipartActionRequests available to controllers.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/portlet/multipart/PortletMultipartResolver.html
AbstractController	A										<section class="prog__container">Convenient superclass for controller implementations, using the Template Method design pattern. As stated in the Controller interface, a lot of functionality is already provided by certain abstract base controllers. The AbstractController is one of the most important abstract base controller providing basic features such controlling if a session is required and render caching. Workflow (and that defined by interface):If this is an action request, handleActionRequest will be called by the DispatcherPortlet once to perform the action defined by this controller.If a session is required, try to get it (PortletException if not found).Call method handleActionRequestInternal, (optionally synchronizing around the call on the PortletSession), which should be overridden by extending classes to provide actual functionality to perform the desired action of the controller.  This will be executed only once.For a straight render request, or the render phase of an action request (assuming the same controller is called for the render phase -- see tip below), handleRenderRequest will be called by the DispatcherPortlet repeatedly to render the display defined by this controller.If a session is required, try to get it (PortletException if none found).It will control caching as defined by the cacheSeconds property.Call method handleRenderRequestInternal, (optionally synchronizing around the call on the PortletSession), which should be overridden by extending classes to provide actual functionality to return ModelAndView objects. This will be executed repeatedly as the portal updates the current displayed page.Exposed configuration properties (and those defined by interface):name</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/portlet/mvc/AbstractController.html
Controller	A										<section class="prog__container">Base portlet Controller interface, representing a component that receives RenderRequest/RenderResponse and ActionRequest/ActionResponse like a Portlet but is able to participate in an MVC workflow. Any implementation of the portlet Controller interface should be a reusable, threadsafe class, capable of handling multiple portlet requests throughout the lifecycle of an application. To be able to configure Controller(s) in an easy way, Controllers are usually JavaBeans.Workflow:After the DispatcherPortlet has received a request and has done its work to resolve locales, themes and suchlike, it tries to resolve a Controller to handle that request, using a HandlerMapping. When a Controller has been found, the handleRenderRequest or handleActionRequest method will be invoked, which is responsible for handling the actual request and - if applicable - returning an appropriate ModelAndView. So actually, these method are the main entrypoint for the DispatcherPortlet which delegates requests to controllers.So basically any direct implementation of the Controller interface just handles RenderRequests/ActionRequests and should return a ModelAndView, to be further used by the DispatcherPortlet. Any additional functionality such as optional validation, form handling, etc should be obtained through extending one of the abstract controller classes mentioned above.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/portlet/mvc/Controller.html
EventAwareController	A										<section class="prog__container">Extension of the Portlet Controller interface that allows for handling Portlet 2.0 event requests as well.

ParameterizableViewController	A										<section class="prog__container">Trivial controller that always returns a named view. The view can be configured using an exposed configuration property. This controller offers an alternative to sending a request straight to a view such as a JSP. The advantage here is that the client is not exposed to the concrete view technology but rather just to the controller URL; the concrete view will be determined by the ViewResolver.

AnnotationMethodHandlerAdapter	A										<section class="prog__container">Implementation of the HandlerAdapter interface that maps handler methods based on portlet modes, action/render phases and request parameters expressed through the RequestMapping annotation. Supports request parameter binding through the RequestParam annotation. Also supports the ModelAttribute annotation for exposing model attribute values to the view, as well as InitBinder for binder initialization methods and SessionAttributes for automatic session management of specific attributes. This adapter can be customized through various bean properties. A common use case is to apply shared binder initialization logic through a custom WebBindingInitializer.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/portlet/mvc/annotation/AnnotationMethodHandlerAdapter.html

DefaultAnnotationHandlerMapping	A										<section class="prog__container">Implementation of the HandlerMapping interface that maps handlers based on portlet modes expressed through the RequestMapping annotation at the type or method level. Registered by default in DispatcherPortlet. NOTE: If you define custom HandlerMapping beans in your DispatcherPortlet context, you need to add a DefaultAnnotationHandlerMapping bean explicitly, since custom HandlerMapping beans replace the default mapping strategies. Defining a DefaultAnnotationHandlerMapping also allows for registering custom interceptors:  <bean class="org.springframework.web.portlet.mvc.annotation.DefaultAnnotationHandlerMapping">   <property name="interceptors">     ...   </property> </bean> Annotated controllers are usually marked with the Controller stereotype at the type level. This is not strictly necessary when RequestMapping is applied at the type level (since such a handler usually implements the Controller interface). However, Controller is required for detecting RequestMapping annotations at the method level. NOTE: Method-level mappings are only allowed to narrow the mapping expressed at the class level (if any). A portlet mode in combination with specific parameter conditions needs to uniquely map onto one specific handler bean, not spread across multiple handler beans. It is strongly recommended to co-locate related handler methods into the same bean. The AnnotationMethodHandlerAdapter is responsible for processing annotated handler methods, as mapped by this HandlerMapping. For RequestMapping at the type level, specific HandlerAdapters such as SimpleControllerHandlerAdapter apply.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/portlet/mvc/annotation/DefaultAnnotationHandlerMapping.html

AsyncHandlerInterceptor	A										<section class="prog__container">Extends HandlerInterceptor with a callback method invoked after the start of asynchronous request handling. When a handler starts an asynchronous request, the DispatcherServlet exits without invoking postHandle and afterCompletion as it normally does for a synchronous request, since the result of request handling (e.g. ModelAndView) is likely not yet ready and will be produced concurrently from another thread. In such scenarios, afterConcurrentHandlingStarted(javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest, javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse, java.lang.Object) is invoked instead, allowing implementations to perform tasks such as cleaning up thread-bound attributes before releasing the thread to the Servlet container. When asynchronous handling completes, the request is dispatched to the container for further processing. At this stage the DispatcherServlet invokes preHandle, postHandle, and afterCompletion. To distinguish between the initial request and the subsequent dispatch after asynchronous handling completes, interceptors can check whether the javax.servlet.DispatcherType of ServletRequest is "REQUEST" or "ASYNC". Note that HandlerInterceptor implementations may need to do work when an async request times out or completes with a network error. For such cases the Servlet container does not dispatch and therefore the postHandle and afterCompletion methods will not be invoked. Instead, interceptors can register to track an asynchronous request through the registerCallbackInterceptor and registerDeferredResultInterceptor methods on WebAsyncManager. This can be done proactively on every request from preHandle regardless of whether async request processing will start.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/AsyncHandlerInterceptor.html
DispatcherServlet	A										<section class="prog__container">Central dispatcher for HTTP request handlers/controllers, e.g. for web UI controllers or HTTP-based remote service exporters. Dispatches to registered handlers for processing a web request, providing convenient mapping and exception handling facilities. This servlet is very flexible: It can be used with just about any workflow, with the installation of the appropriate adapter classes. It offers the following functionality that distinguishes it from other request-driven web MVC frameworks: It is based around a JavaBeans configuration mechanism. It can use any HandlerMapping implementation - pre-built or provided as part of an application - to control the routing of requests to handler objects. Default is BeanNameUrlHandlerMapping and DefaultAnnotationHandlerMapping. HandlerMapping objects can be defined as beans in the servlet's application context, implementing the HandlerMapping interface, overriding the default HandlerMapping if present. HandlerMappings can be given any bean name (they are tested by type). It can use any HandlerAdapter; this allows for using any handler interface. Default adapters are HttpRequestHandlerAdapter, SimpleControllerHandlerAdapter, for Spring's HttpRequestHandler and Controller interfaces, respectively. A default AnnotationMethodHandlerAdapter will be registered as well. HandlerAdapter objects can be added as beans in the application context, overriding the default HandlerAdapters. Like HandlerMappings, HandlerAdapters can be given any bean name (they are tested by type). The dispatcher's exception resolution strategy can be specified via a HandlerExceptionResolver, for example mapping certain exceptions to error pages. Default are AnnotationMethodHandlerExceptionResolver, ResponseStatusExceptionResolver, and DefaultHandlerExceptionResolver. These HandlerExceptionResolvers can be overridden through the application context. HandlerExceptionResolver can be given any bean name (they are tested by type). Its view resolution strategy can be specified via a ViewResolver implementation, resolving symbolic view names into View objects. Default is InternalResourceViewResolver. ViewResolver objects can be added as beans in the application context, overriding the default ViewResolver. ViewResolvers can be given any bean name (they are tested by type). If a View or view name is not supplied by the user, then the configured RequestToViewNameTranslator will translate the current request into a view name. The corresponding bean name is "viewNameTranslator"; the default is DefaultRequestToViewNameTranslator. The dispatcher's strategy for resolving multipart requests is determined by a MultipartResolver implementation. Implementations for Apache Commons FileUpload and Servlet 3 are included; the typical choice is CommonsMultipartResolver. The MultipartResolver bean name is "multipartResolver"; default is none. Its locale resolution strategy is determined by a LocaleResolver. Out-of-the-box implementations work via HTTP accept header, cookie, or session. The LocaleResolver bean name is "localeResolver"; default is AcceptHeaderLocaleResolver. Its theme resolution strategy is determined by a ThemeResolver. Implementations for a fixed theme and for cookie and session storage are included. The ThemeResolver bean name is "themeResolver"; default is FixedThemeResolver. NOTE: The @RequestMapping annotation will only be processed if a corresponding HandlerMapping (for type-level annotations) and/or HandlerAdapter (for method-level annotations) is present in the dispatcher. This is the case by default. However, if you are defining custom HandlerMappings or HandlerAdapters, then you need to make sure that a corresponding custom DefaultAnnotationHandlerMapping and/or AnnotationMethodHandlerAdapter is defined as well - provided that you intend to use @RequestMapping. A web application can define any number of DispatcherServlets. Each servlet will operate in its own namespace, loading its own application context with mappings, handlers, etc. Only the root application context as loaded by ContextLoaderListener, if any, will be shared. As of Spring 3.1, DispatcherServlet may now be injected with a web application context, rather than creating its own internally. This is useful in Servlet 3.0+ environments, which support programmatic registration of servlet instances. See the DispatcherServlet(WebApplicationContext) javadoc for details.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/DispatcherServlet.html
FlashMap	A										<section class="prog__container">A FlashMap provides a way for one request to store attributes intended for use in another. This is most commonly needed when redirecting from one URL to another -- e.g. the Post/Redirect/Get pattern. A FlashMap is saved before the redirect (typically in the session) and is made available after the redirect and removed immediately. A FlashMap can be set up with a request path and request parameters to help identify the target request. Without this information, a FlashMap is made available to the next request, which may or may not be the intended recipient. On a redirect, the target URL is known and a FlashMap can be updated with that information. This is done automatically when the org.springframework.web.servlet.view.RedirectView is used. Note: annotated controllers will usually not use FlashMap directly. See org.springframework.web.servlet.mvc.support.RedirectAttributes for an overview of using flash attributes in annotated controllers.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/FlashMap.html
FlashMapManager	A										<section class="prog__container">A strategy interface for retrieving and saving FlashMap instances. See FlashMap for a general overview of flash attributes.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/FlashMapManager.html
FrameworkServlet	A										<section class="prog__container">Base servlet for Spring's web framework. Provides integration with a Spring application context, in a JavaBean-based overall solution. This class offers the following functionality: Manages a WebApplicationContext instance per servlet. The servlet's configuration is determined by beans in the servlet's namespace. Publishes events on request processing, whether or not a request is successfully handled. Subclasses must implement doService(javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest, javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse) to handle requests. Because this extends HttpServletBean rather than HttpServlet directly, bean properties are automatically mapped onto it. Subclasses can override initFrameworkServlet() for custom initialization. Detects a "contextClass" parameter at the servlet init-param level, falling back to the default context class, XmlWebApplicationContext, if not found. Note that, with the default FrameworkServlet, a custom context class needs to implement the ConfigurableWebApplicationContext SPI. Accepts an optional "contextInitializerClasses" servlet init-param that specifies one or more ApplicationContextInitializer classes. The managed web application context will be delegated to these initializers, allowing for additional programmatic configuration, e.g. adding property sources or activating profiles against the context's environment. See also ContextLoader which supports a "contextInitializerClasses" context-param with identical semantics for the "root" web application context. Passes a "contextConfigLocation" servlet init-param to the context instance, parsing it into potentially multiple file paths which can be separated by any number of commas and spaces, like "test-servlet.xml, myServlet.xml". If not explicitly specified, the context implementation is supposed to build a default location from the namespace of the servlet. Note: In case of multiple config locations, later bean definitions will override ones defined in earlier loaded files, at least when using Spring's default ApplicationContext implementation. This can be leveraged to deliberately override certain bean definitions via an extra XML file. The default namespace is "'servlet-name'-servlet", e.g. "test-servlet" for a servlet-name "test" (leading to a "/WEB-INF/test-servlet.xml" default location with XmlWebApplicationContext). The namespace can also be set explicitly via the "namespace" servlet init-param. As of Spring 3.1, FrameworkServlet may now be injected with a web application context, rather than creating its own internally. This is useful in Servlet 3.0+ environments, which support programmatic registration of servlet instances. See FrameworkServlet(WebApplicationContext) Javadoc for details.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/FrameworkServlet.html
HandlerAdapter	A										<section class="prog__container">MVC framework SPI, allowing parameterization of the core MVC workflow. Interface that must be implemented for each handler type to handle a request. This interface is used to allow the DispatcherServlet to be indefinitely extensible. The DispatcherServlet accesses all installed handlers through this interface, meaning that it does not contain code specific to any handler type. Note that a handler can be of type Object. This is to enable handlers from other frameworks to be integrated with this framework without custom coding, as well as to allow for annotation-driven handler objects that do not obey any specific Java interface. This interface is not intended for application developers. It is available to handlers who want to develop their own web workflow. Note: HandlerAdapter implementors may implement the Ordered interface to be able to specify a sorting order (and thus a priority) for getting applied by the DispatcherServlet. Non-Ordered instances get treated as lowest priority.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/HandlerAdapter.html
HandlerExceptionResolver	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface to be implemented by objects that can resolve exceptions thrown during handler mapping or execution, in the typical case to error views. Implementors are typically registered as beans in the application context. Error views are analogous to JSP error pages but can be used with any kind of exception including any checked exception, with potentially fine-grained mappings for specific handlers.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/HandlerExceptionResolver.html
HandlerExecutionChain	A										<section class="prog__container">Handler execution chain, consisting of handler object and any handler interceptors. Returned by HandlerMapping's HandlerMapping.getHandler(javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest) method.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/HandlerExecutionChain.html
HandlerInterceptor	A										<section class="prog__container">Workflow interface that allows for customized handler execution chains. Applications can register any number of existing or custom interceptors for certain groups of handlers, to add common preprocessing behavior without needing to modify each handler implementation. A HandlerInterceptor gets called before the appropriate HandlerAdapter triggers the execution of the handler itself. This mechanism can be used for a large field of preprocessing aspects, e.g. for authorization checks, or common handler behavior like locale or theme changes. Its main purpose is to allow for factoring out repetitive handler code. In an asynchronous processing scenario, the handler may be executed in a separate thread while the main thread exits without rendering or invoking the postHandle and afterCompletion callbacks. When concurrent handler execution completes, the request is dispatched back in order to proceed with rendering the model and all methods of this contract are invoked again. For further options and details see org.springframework.web.servlet.AsyncHandlerInterceptorTypically an interceptor chain is defined per HandlerMapping bean, sharing its granularity. To be able to apply a certain interceptor chain to a group of handlers, one needs to map the desired handlers via one HandlerMapping bean. The interceptors themselves are defined as beans in the application context, referenced by the mapping bean definition via its "interceptors" property (in XML: a <list> of <ref>). HandlerInterceptor is basically similar to a Servlet Filter, but in contrast to the latter it just allows custom pre-processing with the option of prohibiting the execution of the handler itself, and custom post-processing. Filters are more powerful, for example they allow for exchanging the request and response objects that are handed down the chain. Note that a filter gets configured in web.xml, a HandlerInterceptor in the application context. As a basic guideline, fine-grained handler-related preprocessing tasks are candidates for HandlerInterceptor implementations, especially factored-out common handler code and authorization checks. On the other hand, a Filter is well-suited for request content and view content handling, like multipart forms and GZIP compression. This typically shows when one needs to map the filter to certain content types (e.g. images), or to all requests.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/HandlerInterceptor.html
HandlerMapping	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface to be implemented by objects that define a mapping between requests and handler objects. This class can be implemented by application developers, although this is not necessary, as BeanNameUrlHandlerMapping and DefaultAnnotationHandlerMapping are included in the framework. The former is the default if no HandlerMapping bean is registered in the application context. HandlerMapping implementations can support mapped interceptors but do not have to. A handler will always be wrapped in a HandlerExecutionChain instance, optionally accompanied by some HandlerInterceptor instances. The DispatcherServlet will first call each HandlerInterceptor's preHandle method in the given order, finally invoking the handler itself if all preHandle methods have returned true. The ability to parameterize this mapping is a powerful and unusual capability of this MVC framework. For example, it is possible to write a custom mapping based on session state, cookie state or many other variables. No other MVC framework seems to be equally flexible. Note: Implementations can implement the Ordered interface to be able to specify a sorting order and thus a priority for getting applied by DispatcherServlet. Non-Ordered instances get treated as lowest priority.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/HandlerMapping.html
HttpServletBean	A										<section class="prog__container">Simple extension of HttpServlet which treats its config parameters (init-param entries within the servlet tag in web.xml) as bean properties. A handy superclass for any type of servlet. Type conversion of config parameters is automatic, with the corresponding setter method getting invoked with the converted value. It is also possible for subclasses to specify required properties. Parameters without matching bean property setter will simply be ignored. This servlet leaves request handling to subclasses, inheriting the default behavior of HttpServlet (doGet, doPost, etc). This generic servlet base class has no dependency on the Spring ApplicationContext concept. Simple servlets usually don't load their own context but rather access service beans from the Spring root application context, accessible via the filter's ServletContext (see WebApplicationContextUtils). The FrameworkServlet class is a more specific servlet base class which loads its own application context. FrameworkServlet serves as direct base class of Spring's full-fledged DispatcherServlet.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/HttpServletBean.html
LocaleContextResolver	A										<section class="prog__container">Extension of LocaleResolver, adding support for a rich locale context (potentially including locale and time zone information).</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/LocaleContextResolver.html
LocaleResolver	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface for web-based locale resolution strategies that allows for both locale resolution via the request and locale modification via request and response. This interface allows for implementations based on request, session, cookies, etc. The default implementation is AcceptHeaderLocaleResolver, simply using the request's locale provided by the respective HTTP header. Use RequestContext.getLocale() to retrieve the current locale in controllers or views, independent of the actual resolution strategy. Note: As of Spring 4.0, there is an extended strategy interface called LocaleContextResolver, allowing for resolution of a LocaleContext object, potentially including associated time zone information. Spring's provided resolver implementations implement the extended LocaleContextResolver interface wherever appropriate.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/LocaleResolver.html
ModelAndView	A										<section class="prog__container">Holder for both Model and View in the web MVC framework. Note that these are entirely distinct. This class merely holds both to make it possible for a controller to return both model and view in a single return value. Represents a model and view returned by a handler, to be resolved by a DispatcherServlet. The view can take the form of a String view name which will need to be resolved by a ViewResolver object; alternatively a View object can be specified directly. The model is a Map, allowing the use of multiple objects keyed by name.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/ModelAndView.html
ModelAndViewDefiningException	A										<section class="prog__container">Exception to be thrown on error conditions that should forward to a specific view with a specific model. Can be thrown at any time during handler processing. This includes any template methods of pre-built controllers. For example, a form controller might abort to a specific error page if certain parameters do not allow to proceed with the normal workflow.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/ModelAndViewDefiningException.html
NoHandlerFoundException	A										<section class="prog__container">By default when the DispatcherServlet can't find a handler for a request it sends a 404 response. However if its property "throwExceptionIfNoHandlerFound" is set to true this exception is raised and may be handled with a configured HandlerExceptionResolver.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/NoHandlerFoundException.html
RequestToViewNameTranslator	A										<section class="prog__container">Strategy interface for translating an incoming HttpServletRequest into a logical view name when no view name is explicitly supplied.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/RequestToViewNameTranslator.html
ResourceServlet	A										<section class="prog__container">Simple servlet that can expose an internal resource, including a default URL if the specified resource is not found. An alternative, for example, to trying and catching exceptions when using JSP include. A further usage of this servlet is the ability to apply last-modified timestamps to quasi-static resources (typically JSPs). This can happen as bridge to parameter-specified resources, or as proxy for a specific target resource (or a list of specific target resources to combine). A typical usage would map a URL like "/ResourceServlet" onto an instance of this servlet, and use the "JSP include" action to include this URL, with the "resource" parameter indicating the actual target path in the WAR. The defaultUrl property can be set to the internal resource path of a default URL, to be rendered when the target resource is not found or not specified in the first place. The "resource" parameter and the defaultUrl property can also specify a list of target resources to combine. Those resources will be included one by one to build the response. If last-modified determination is active, the newest timestamp among those files will be used. The allowedResources property can be set to a URL pattern of resources that should be available via this servlet. If not set, any target resource can be requested, including resources in the WEB-INF directory! If using this servlet for direct access rather than via includes, the contentType property should be specified to apply a proper content type. Note that a content type header in the target JSP will be ignored when including the resource via a RequestDispatcher include. To apply last-modified timestamps for the target resource, set the applyLastModified property to true. This servlet will then return the file timestamp of the target resource as last-modified value, falling back to the startup time of this servlet if not retrievable. Note that applying the last-modified timestamp in the above fashion just makes sense if the target resource does not generate content that depends on the HttpSession or cookies; it is just allowed to evaluate request parameters. A typical case for such last-modified usage is a JSP that just makes minimal usage of basic means like includes or message resolution to build quasi-static content. Regenerating such content on every request is unnecessary; it can be cached as long as the file hasn't changed. Note that this servlet will apply the last-modified timestamp if you tell it to do so: It's your decision whether the content of the target resource can be cached in such a fashion. Typical use cases are helper resources that are not fronted by a controller, like JavaScript files that are generated by a JSP (without depending on the HttpSession).</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/ResourceServlet.html
SmartView	A										<section class="prog__container">Provides additional information about a View such as whether it performs redirects.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/SmartView.html
ThemeResolver	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface for web-based theme resolution strategies that allows for both theme resolution via the request and theme modification via request and response. This interface allows for implementations based on session, cookies, etc. The default implementation is FixedThemeResolver, simply using a configured default theme. Note that this resolver is only responsible for determining the current theme name. The Theme instance for the resolved theme name gets looked up by DispatcherServlet via the respective ThemeSource, i.e. the current WebApplicationContext. Use RequestContext.getTheme() to retrieve the current theme in controllers or views, independent of the actual resolution strategy.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/ThemeResolver.html
View	A										<section class="prog__container">MVC View for a web interaction. Implementations are responsible for rendering content, and exposing the model. A single view exposes multiple model attributes. This class and the MVC approach associated with it is discussed in Chapter 12 of Expert One-On-One J2EE Design and Development by Rod Johnson (Wrox, 2002). View implementations may differ widely. An obvious implementation would be JSP-based. Other implementations might be XSLT-based, or use an HTML generation library. This interface is designed to avoid restricting the range of possible implementations. Views should be beans. They are likely to be instantiated as beans by a ViewResolver. As this interface is stateless, view implementations should be thread-safe.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/View.html
ViewRendererServlet	A										<section class="prog__container">ViewRendererServlet is a bridge servlet, mainly for the Portlet MVC support. For usage with Portlets, this Servlet is necessary to force the portlet container to convert the PortletRequest to a ServletRequest, which it has to do when including a resource via the PortletRequestDispatcher. This allows for reuse of the entire Servlet-based View support even in a Portlet environment. The actual mapping of the bridge servlet is configurable in the DispatcherPortlet, via a "viewRendererUrl" property. The default is "/WEB-INF/servlet/view", which is just available for internal resource dispatching.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/ViewRendererServlet.html
ViewResolver	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface to be implemented by objects that can resolve views by name. View state doesn't change during the running of the application, so implementations are free to cache views. Implementations are encouraged to support internationalization, i.e. localized view resolution.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/ViewResolver.html

All registered resolvers are wrapped in a single (composite) ViewResolver with its order property set to 0 so that other external resolvers may be ordered before or after it. When content negotiation is enabled the order property is set to highest priority instead with the ContentNegotiatingViewResolver encapsulating all other registered view resolver instances.

Since this handler is configured at the lowest precedence, effectively it allows all other handler mappings to handle the request, and if none of them do, this handler can forward it to the "default" Servlet.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/config/annotation/DefaultServletHandlerConfigurer.html

WebMvcConfigurationSupport	A										<section class="prog__container">This is the main class providing the configuration behind the MVC Java config. It is typically imported by adding @EnableWebMvc to an application @Configuration class. An alternative more advanced option is to extend directly from this class and override methods as necessary remembering to add @Configuration to the subclass and @Bean to overridden @Bean methods. For more details see the Javadoc of @EnableWebMvc. This class registers the following HandlerMappings:RequestMappingHandlerMapping ordered at 0 for mapping requests to annotated controller methods. HandlerMapping ordered at 1 to map URL paths directly to view names. BeanNameUrlHandlerMapping ordered at 2 to map URL paths to controller bean names. HandlerMapping ordered at Integer.MAX_VALUE-1 to serve static resource requests. HandlerMapping ordered at Integer.MAX_VALUE to forward requests to the default servlet. Registers these HandlerAdapters: RequestMappingHandlerAdapter for processing requests with annotated controller methods. HttpRequestHandlerAdapter for processing requests with HttpRequestHandlers. SimpleControllerHandlerAdapter for processing requests with interface-based Controllers. Registers a HandlerExceptionResolverComposite with this chain of exception resolvers: ExceptionHandlerExceptionResolver for handling exceptions through @ExceptionHandler methods. ResponseStatusExceptionResolver for exceptions annotated with @ResponseStatus. DefaultHandlerExceptionResolver for resolving known Spring exception types Registers an AntPathMatcher and a UrlPathHelper to be used by: the RequestMappingHandlerMapping, the HandlerMapping for ViewControllers and the HandlerMapping for serving resources  Note that those beans can be configured with a PathMatchConfigurer. Both the RequestMappingHandlerAdapter and the ExceptionHandlerExceptionResolver are configured with default instances of the following by default: a ContentNegotiationManagera DefaultFormattingConversionServicea OptionalValidatorFactoryBean if a JSR-303 implementation is available on the classpath a range of HttpMessageConverters depending on the third-party libraries available on the classpath. </section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/config/annotation/WebMvcConfigurationSupport.html

AbstractHandlerMapping	A										<section class="prog__container">Abstract base class for HandlerMapping implementations. Supports ordering, a default handler, handler interceptors, including handler interceptors mapped by path patterns. Note: This base class does not support exposure of the HandlerMapping.PATH_WITHIN_HANDLER_MAPPING_ATTRIBUTE. Support for this attribute is up to concrete subclasses, typically based on request URL mappings.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/handler/AbstractHandlerMapping.html

AbstractUrlHandlerMapping	A										<section class="prog__container">Abstract base class for URL-mapped HandlerMapping implementations. Provides infrastructure for mapping handlers to URLs and configurable URL lookup. For information on the latter, see "alwaysUseFullPath" property. Supports direct matches, e.g. a registered "/test" matches "/test", and various Ant-style pattern matches, e.g. a registered "/t*" pattern matches both "/test" and "/team", "/test/*" matches all paths in the "/test" directory, "/test/**" matches all paths below "/test". For details, see the AntPathMatcher javadoc. Will search all path patterns to find the most exact match for the current request path. The most exact match is defined as the longest path pattern that matches the current request path.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/handler/AbstractUrlHandlerMapping.html
BeanNameUrlHandlerMapping	A										<section class="prog__container">Implementation of the HandlerMapping interface that map from URLs to beans with names that start with a slash ("/"), similar to how Struts maps URLs to action names. This is the default implementation used by the DispatcherServlet, along with DefaultAnnotationHandlerMapping. Alternatively, SimpleUrlHandlerMapping allows for customizing a handler mapping declaratively. The mapping is from URL to bean name. Thus an incoming URL "/foo" would map to a handler named "/foo", or to "/foo /foo2" in case of multiple mappings to a single handler. Note: In XML definitions, you'll need to use an alias name="/foo" in the bean definition, as the XML id may not contain slashes. Supports direct matches (given "/test" -> registered "/test") and "*" matches (given "/test" -> registered "/t*"). Note that the default is to map within the current servlet mapping if applicable; see the "alwaysUseFullPath" property for details. For details on the pattern options, see the AntPathMatcher javadoc.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/handler/BeanNameUrlHandlerMapping.html

HandlerMethodMappingNamingStrategy	A										<section class="prog__container">A strategy for assigning a name to a handler method's mapping. The strategy can be configured on AbstractHandlerMethodMapping. It is used to assign a name to the mapping of every registered handler method. The names can then be queried via AbstractHandlerMethodMapping#getHandlerMethodsForMappingName. Applications can build a URL to a controller method by name with the help of the static method MvcUriComponentsBuilder#fromMappingName or in JSPs through the "mvcUrl" function registered by the Spring tag library.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/handler/HandlerMethodMappingNamingStrategy.html
MappedInterceptor	A										<section class="prog__container">Contains and delegates calls to a HandlerInterceptor along with include (and optionally exclude) path patterns to which the interceptor should apply. Also provides matching logic to test if the interceptor applies to a given request path. A MappedInterceptor can be registered directly with any AbstractHandlerMethodMapping. Furthermore, beans of type MappedInterceptor are automatically detected by AbstractHandlerMethodMapping (including ancestor ApplicationContext's) which effectively means the interceptor is registered "globally" with all handler mappings.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/handler/MappedInterceptor.html
MatchableHandlerMapping	A										<section class="prog__container">Additional interface that a HandlerMapping can implement to expose a request matching API aligned with its internal request matching configuration and implementation.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/handler/MatchableHandlerMapping.html

SimpleMappingExceptionResolver	A										<section class="prog__container">HandlerExceptionResolver implementation that allows for mapping exception class names to view names, either for a set of given handlers or for all handlers in the DispatcherServlet. Error views are analogous to error page JSPs, but can be used with any kind of exception including any checked one, with fine-granular mappings for specific handlers.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/handler/SimpleMappingExceptionResolver.html
SimpleServletHandlerAdapter	A										<section class="prog__container">Adapter to use the Servlet interface with the generic DispatcherServlet. Calls the Servlet's service method to handle a request. Last-modified checking is not explicitly supported: This is typically handled by the Servlet implementation itself (usually deriving from the HttpServlet base class). This adapter is not activated by default; it needs to be defined as a bean in the DispatcherServlet context. It will automatically apply to mapped handler beans that implement the Servlet interface then. Note that Servlet instances defined as bean will not receive initialization and destruction callbacks, unless a special post-processor such as SimpleServletPostProcessor is defined in the DispatcherServlet context. Alternatively, consider wrapping a Servlet with Spring's ServletWrappingController. This is particularly appropriate for existing Servlet classes, allowing to specify Servlet initialization parameters etc.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/handler/SimpleServletHandlerAdapter.html
SimpleServletPostProcessor	A										<section class="prog__container">BeanPostProcessor that applies initialization and destruction callbacks to beans that implement the Servlet interface. After initialization of the bean instance, the Servlet init method will be called with a ServletConfig that contains the bean name of the Servlet and the ServletContext that it is running in. Before destruction of the bean instance, the Servlet destroy will be called. Note that this post-processor does not support Servlet initialization parameters. Bean instances that implement the Servlet interface are supposed to be configured like any other Spring bean, that is, through constructor arguments or bean properties. For reuse of a Servlet implementation in a plain Servlet container and as a bean in a Spring context, consider deriving from Spring's HttpServletBean base class that applies Servlet initialization parameters as bean properties, supporting both the standard Servlet and the Spring bean initialization style. Alternatively, consider wrapping a Servlet with Spring's ServletWrappingController. This is particularly appropriate for existing Servlet classes, allowing to specify Servlet initialization parameters etc.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/handler/SimpleServletPostProcessor.html
SimpleUrlHandlerMapping	A										<section class="prog__container">Implementation of the HandlerMapping interface to map from URLs to request handler beans. Supports both mapping to bean instances and mapping to bean names; the latter is required for non-singleton handlers. The "urlMap" property is suitable for populating the handler map with bean references, e.g. via the map element in XML bean definitions. Mappings to bean names can be set via the "mappings" property, in a form accepted by the java.util.Properties class, like as follows:/welcome.html=ticketController /show.html=ticketController  The syntax is PATH=HANDLER_BEAN_NAME. If the path doesn't begin with a slash, one is prepended. Supports direct matches (given "/test" -> registered "/test") and "*" pattern matches (given "/test" -> registered "/t*"). Note that the default is to map within the current servlet mapping if applicable; see the "alwaysUseFullPath" property. For details on the pattern options, see the AntPathMatcher javadoc.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/handler/SimpleUrlHandlerMapping.html

AcceptHeaderLocaleResolver	A										<section class="prog__container">LocaleResolver implementation that simply uses the primary locale specified in the "accept-language" header of the HTTP request (that is, the locale sent by the client browser, normally that of the client's OS). Note: Does not support setLocale, since the accept header can only be changed through changing the client's locale settings.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/i18n/AcceptHeaderLocaleResolver.html
CookieLocaleResolver	A										<section class="prog__container">LocaleResolver implementation that uses a cookie sent back to the user in case of a custom setting, with a fallback to the specified default locale or the request's accept-header locale. This is particularly useful for stateless applications without user sessions. The cookie may optionally contain an associated time zone value as well; alternatively, you may specify a default time zone. Custom controllers can override the user's locale and time zone by calling #setLocale(Context) on the resolver, e.g. responding to a locale change request. As a more convenient alternative, consider using RequestContext.changeLocale(java.util.Locale).</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/i18n/CookieLocaleResolver.html
FixedLocaleResolver	A										<section class="prog__container">LocaleResolver implementation that always returns a fixed default locale and optionally time zone. Default is the current JVM's default locale. Note: Does not support setLocale(Context), as the fixed locale and time zone cannot be changed.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/i18n/FixedLocaleResolver.html
LocaleChangeInterceptor	A										<section class="prog__container">Interceptor that allows for changing the current locale on every request, via a configurable request parameter (default parameter name: "locale").</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/i18n/LocaleChangeInterceptor.html
SessionLocaleResolver	A										<section class="prog__container">LocaleResolver implementation that uses a locale attribute in the user's session in case of a custom setting, with a fallback to the specified default locale or the request's accept-header locale. This is most appropriate if the application needs user sessions anyway, i.e. when the HttpSession does not have to be created just for storing the user's locale. The session may optionally contain an associated time zone attribute as well; alternatively, you may specify a default time zone. Custom controllers can override the user's locale and time zone by calling #setLocale(Context) on the resolver, e.g. responding to a locale change request. As a more convenient alternative, consider using RequestContext.changeLocale(java.util.Locale). In contrast to CookieLocaleResolver, this strategy stores locally chosen locale settings in the Servlet container's HttpSession. As a consequence, those settings are just temporary for each session and therefore lost when each session terminates. Note that there is no direct relationship with external session management mechanisms such as the "Spring Session" project. This LocaleResolver will simply evaluate and modify corresponding HttpSession attributes against the current HttpServletRequest.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/i18n/SessionLocaleResolver.html
AbstractController	A										<section class="prog__container">Convenient superclass for controller implementations, using the Template Method design pattern.

AbstractUrlViewController	A										<section class="prog__container">Abstract base class for Controllers that return a view name based on the request URL. Provides infrastructure for determining view names from URLs and configurable URL lookup. For information on the latter, see alwaysUseFullPath and urlDecode properties.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/mvc/AbstractUrlViewController.html
Controller	A										<section class="prog__container">Base Controller interface, representing a component that receives HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse instances just like a HttpServlet but is able to participate in an MVC workflow. Controllers are comparable to the notion of a Struts Action. Any implementation of the Controller interface should be a reusable, thread-safe class, capable of handling multiple HTTP requests throughout the lifecycle of an application. To be able to configure a Controller easily, Controller implementations are encouraged to be (and usually are) JavaBeans. WorkflowAfter a DispatcherServlet has received a request and has done its work to resolve locales, themes, and suchlike, it then tries to resolve a Controller, using a HandlerMapping. When a Controller has been found to handle the request, the handleRequest method of the located Controller will be invoked; the located Controller is then responsible for handling the actual request and — if applicable — returning an appropriate ModelAndView. So actually, this method is the main entry point for the DispatcherServlet which delegates requests to controllers. So basically any direct implementation of the Controller interface just handles HttpServletRequests and should return a ModelAndView, to be further interpreted by the DispatcherServlet. Any additional functionality such as optional validation, form handling, etc. should be obtained through extending AbstractController or one of its subclasses. Notes on design and testingThe Controller interface is explicitly designed to operate on HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse objects, just like an HttpServlet. It does not aim to decouple itself from the Servlet API, in contrast to, for example, WebWork, JSF or Tapestry. Instead, the full power of the Servlet API is available, allowing Controllers to be general-purpose: a Controller is able to not only handle web user interface requests but also to process remoting protocols or to generate reports on demand. Controllers can easily be tested by passing in mock objects for the HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse objects as parameters to the handleRequest method. As a convenience, Spring ships with a set of Servlet API mocks that are suitable for testing any kind of web components, but are particularly suitable for testing Spring web controllers. In contrast to a Struts Action, there is no need to mock the ActionServlet or any other infrastructure; mocking HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse is sufficient. If Controllers need to be aware of specific environment references, they can choose to implement specific awareness interfaces, just like any other bean in a Spring (web) application context can do, for example: org.springframework.context.ApplicationContextAwareorg.springframework.context.ResourceLoaderAwareorg.springframework.web.context.ServletContextAwareSuch environment references can easily be passed in testing environments, through the corresponding setters defined in the respective awareness interfaces. In general, it is recommended to keep the dependencies as minimal as possible: for example, if all you need is resource loading, implement ResourceLoaderAware only. Alternatively, derive from the WebApplicationObjectSupport base class, which gives you all those references through convenient accessors but requires an ApplicationContext reference on initialization. Controllers can optionally implement the LastModified interface.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/mvc/Controller.html
HttpRequestHandlerAdapter	A										<section class="prog__container">Adapter to use the plain HttpRequestHandler interface with the generic DispatcherServlet. Supports handlers that implement the LastModified interface. This is an SPI class, not used directly by application code.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/mvc/HttpRequestHandlerAdapter.html
LastModified	A										<section class="prog__container">Supports last-modified HTTP requests to facilitate content caching. Same contract as for the Servlet API's getLastModified method. Delegated to by a HandlerAdapter.getLastModified(javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest, java.lang.Object) implementation. By default, any Controller or HttpRequestHandler within Spring's default framework can implement this interface to enable last-modified checking. Note: Alternative handler implementation approaches have different last-modified handling styles. For example, Spring 2.5's annotated controller approach (using @RequestMapping) provides last-modified support through the WebRequest.checkNotModified(long) method, allowing for last-modified checking within the main handler method.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/mvc/LastModified.html
ParameterizableViewController	A										<section class="prog__container">Trivial controller that always returns a pre-configured view and optionally sets the response status code. The view and status can be configured using the provided configuration properties.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/mvc/ParameterizableViewController.html
ServletForwardingController	A										<section class="prog__container">Spring Controller implementation that forwards to a named servlet, i.e. the "servlet-name" in web.xml rather than a URL path mapping. A target servlet doesn't even need a "servlet-mapping" in web.xml in the first place: A "servlet" declaration is sufficient. Useful to invoke an existing servlet via Spring's dispatching infrastructure, for example to apply Spring HandlerInterceptors to its requests. This will work even in a minimal Servlet container that does not support Servlet filters. Example: web.xml, mapping all "/myservlet" requests to a Spring dispatcher.

ServletWrappingController	A										<section class="prog__container">Spring Controller implementation that wraps a servlet instance which it manages internally. Such a wrapped servlet is not known outside of this controller; its entire lifecycle is covered here (in contrast to ServletForwardingController). Useful to invoke an existing servlet via Spring's dispatching infrastructure, for example to apply Spring HandlerInterceptors to its requests. Note that Struts has a special requirement in that it parses web.xml to find its servlet mapping. Therefore, you need to specify the DispatcherServlet's servlet name as "servletName" on this controller, so that Struts finds the DispatcherServlet's mapping (thinking that it refers to the ActionServlet). Example: a DispatcherServlet XML context, forwarding "*.do" to the Struts ActionServlet wrapped by a ServletWrappingController. All such requests will go through the configured HandlerInterceptor chain (e.g. an OpenSessionInViewInterceptor). From the Struts point of view, everything will work as usual.  <bean id="urlMapping" class="org.springframework.web.servlet.handler.SimpleUrlHandlerMapping">   <property name="interceptors">     <list>       <ref bean="openSessionInViewInterceptor"/>     </list>   </property>   <property name="mappings">     <props>       <prop key="*.do">strutsWrappingController</prop>     </props>   </property> </bean> <bean id="strutsWrappingController" class="org.springframework.web.servlet.mvc.ServletWrappingController">   <property name="servletClass">     <value>org.apache.struts.action.ActionServlet</value>   </property>   <property name="servletName">     <value>action</value>   </property>   <property name="initParameters">     <props>       <prop key="config">/WEB-INF/struts-config.xml</prop>     </props>   </property> </bean></section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/mvc/ServletWrappingController.html

If the method parameter type is Map, the name specified in the annotation is used to resolve the URI variable String value. The value is then converted to a Map via type conversion, assuming a suitable Converter or PropertyEditor has been registered. A WebDataBinder is invoked to apply type conversion to resolved path variable values that don't yet match the method parameter type.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/mvc/method/annotation/PathVariableMethodArgumentResolver.html

ResponseEntityExceptionHandler	A										<section class="prog__container">A convenient base class for @ControllerAdvice classes that wish to provide centralized exception handling across all @RequestMapping methods through @ExceptionHandler methods. This base class provides an @ExceptionHandler method for handling internal Spring MVC exceptions. This method returns a ResponseEntity for writing to the response with a message converter. in contrast to DefaultHandlerExceptionResolver which returns a ModelAndView. If there is no need to write error content to the response body, or when using view resolution (e.g., via ContentNegotiatingViewResolver), then DefaultHandlerExceptionResolver is good enough. Note that in order for an @ControllerAdvice sub-class to be detected, ExceptionHandlerExceptionResolver must be configured.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/mvc/method/annotation/ResponseEntityExceptionHandler.html

This exception resolver is enabled by default in the common Spring DispatcherServlet.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/mvc/support/DefaultHandlerExceptionResolver.html
RedirectAttributes	A										<section class="prog__container">A specialization of the Model interface that controllers can use to select attributes for a redirect scenario. Since the intent of adding redirect attributes is very explicit --  i.e. to be used for a redirect URL, attribute values may be formatted as Strings and stored that way to make them eligible to be appended to the query string or expanded as URI variables in org.springframework.web.servlet.view.RedirectView. This interface also provides a way to add flash attributes. For a general overview of flash attributes see FlashMap. You can use RedirectAttributes to store flash attributes and they will be automatically propagated to the "output" FlashMap of the current request. Example usage in an @Controller:  @RequestMapping(value = "/accounts", method = RequestMethod.POST) public String handle(Account account, BindingResult result, RedirectAttributes redirectAttrs) {   if (result.hasErrors()) {     return "accounts/new";   }   // Save account ...   redirectAttrs.addAttribute("id", account.getId()).addFlashAttribute("message", "Account created!");   return "redirect:/accounts/{id}"; } A RedirectAttributes model is empty when the method is called and is never used unless the method returns a redirect view name or a RedirectView. After the redirect, flash attributes are automatically added to the model of the controller that serves the target URL.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/mvc/support/RedirectAttributes.html
RedirectAttributesModelMap	A										<section class="prog__container">A ModelMap implementation of RedirectAttributes that formats values as Strings using a DataBinder. Also provides a place to store flash attributes so they can survive a redirect without the need to be embedded in the redirect URL.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/mvc/support/RedirectAttributesModelMap.html
AbstractResourceResolver	A										<section class="prog__container">Base class for ResourceResolver implementations. Provides consistent logging.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/resource/AbstractResourceResolver.html

AbstractVersionStrategy	A										<section class="prog__container">Abstract base class for VersionStrategy implementations. Supports versions as: prefix in the request path, like "version/static/myresource.js" file name suffix in the request path, like "static/myresource-version.js" Note: This base class does not provide support for generating the version string.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/resource/AbstractVersionStrategy.html
AbstractVersionStrategy.PrefixVersionPathStrategy	A										<section class="prog__container">A prefix-based VersionPathStrategy, e.g. "{version}/path/foo.js".</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/resource/AbstractVersionStrategy.PrefixVersionPathStrategy.html
AppCacheManifestTransformer	A										<section class="prog__container">A ResourceTransformer implementation that helps handling resources within HTML5 AppCache manifests for HTML5 offline applications. This transformer: modifies links to match the public URL paths that should be exposed to clients, using configured ResourceResolver strategies appends a comment in the manifest, containing a Hash (e.g. "# Hash: 9de0f09ed7caf84e885f1f0f11c7e326"), thus changing the content of the manifest in order to trigger an appcache reload in the browser.  All files that have the ".manifest" file extension, or the extension given in the constructor, will be transformed by this class. This hash is computed using the content of the appcache manifest and the content of the linked resources; so changing a resource linked in the manifest or the manifest itself should invalidate the browser cache.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/resource/AppCacheManifestTransformer.html
CachingResourceResolver	A										<section class="prog__container">A ResourceResolver that resolves resources from a Cache or otherwise delegates to the resolver chain and saves the result in the cache.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/resource/CachingResourceResolver.html
CachingResourceTransformer	A										<section class="prog__container">A ResourceTransformer that checks a Cache to see if a previously transformed resource exists in the cache and returns it if found, and otherwise delegates to the resolver chain and saves the result in the cache.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/resource/CachingResourceTransformer.html
ContentVersionStrategy	A										<section class="prog__container">A VersionStrategy that calculates an Hex MD5 hashes from the content of the resource and appends it to the file name, e.g. "styles/main-e36d2e05253c6c7085a91522ce43a0b4.css".</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/resource/ContentVersionStrategy.html

CssLinkResourceTransformer	A										<section class="prog__container">A ResourceTransformer implementation that modifies links in a CSS file to match the public URL paths that should be exposed to clients (e.g. with an MD5 content-based hash inserted in the URL). The implementation looks for links in CSS @import statements and also inside CSS url() functions. All links are then passed through the ResourceResolverChain and resolved relative to the location of the containing CSS file. If successfully resolved, the link is modified, otherwise the original link is preserved.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/resource/CssLinkResourceTransformer.html
DefaultServletHttpRequestHandler	A										<section class="prog__container">An HttpRequestHandler for serving static files using the Servlet container's "default" Servlet. This handler is intended to be used with a "/*" mapping when the DispatcherServlet is mapped to "/", thus  overriding the Servlet container's default handling of static resources. The mapping to this handler should generally be ordered as the last in the chain so that it will only execute when no other more specific mappings (i.e., to controllers) can be matched. Requests are handled by forwarding through the RequestDispatcher obtained via the name specified through the "defaultServletName" property. In most cases, the defaultServletName does not need to be set explicitly, as the handler checks at initialization time for the presence of the default Servlet of well-known containers such as Tomcat, Jetty, Resin, WebLogic and WebSphere. However, when running in a container where the default Servlet's name is not known, or where it has been customized via server configuration, the  defaultServletName will need to be set explicitly.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/resource/DefaultServletHttpRequestHandler.html
EncodedResource	A										<section class="prog__container">Interface for a resource descriptor that describes the encoding applied to the entire resource content. This information is required if the client consuming that resource needs additional decoding capabilities to retrieve the resource's content.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/resource/EncodedResource.html
FixedVersionStrategy	A										<section class="prog__container">A VersionStrategy that relies on a fixed version applied as a request path prefix, e.g. reduced SHA, version name, release date, etc. This is useful for example when ContentVersionStrategy cannot be used such as when using JavaScript module loaders which are in charge of loading the JavaScript resources and need to know their relative paths.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/resource/FixedVersionStrategy.html
GzipResourceResolver	A										<section class="prog__container">A ResourceResolver that delegates to the chain to locate a resource and then attempts to find a variation with the ".gz" extension. The resolver gets involved only if the "Accept-Encoding" request header contains the value "gzip" indicating the client accepts gzipped responses.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/resource/GzipResourceResolver.html
PathResourceResolver	A										<section class="prog__container">A simple ResourceResolver that tries to find a resource under the given locations matching to the request path. This resolver does not delegate to the ResourceResolverChain and is expected to be configured at the end in a chain of resolvers.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/resource/PathResourceResolver.html
ResourceHttpRequestHandler	A										<section class="prog__container">HttpRequestHandler that serves static resources in an optimized way according to the guidelines of Page Speed, YSlow, etc. The "locations" property takes a list of Spring Resource locations from which static resources are allowed to be served by this handler. Resources could be served from a classpath location, e.g. "classpath:/META-INF/public-web-resources/", allowing convenient packaging and serving of resources such as .js, .css, and others in jar files. This request handler may also be configured with a resourcesResolver and resourceTransformer chains to support arbitrary resolution and transformation of resources being served. By default a PathResourceResolver simply finds resources based on the configured "locations". An application can configure additional resolvers and transformers such as the VersionResourceResolver which can resolve and prepare URLs for resources with a version in the URL. This handler also properly evaluates the Last-Modified header (if present) so that a 304 status code will be returned as appropriate, avoiding unnecessary overhead for resources that are already cached by the client.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/resource/ResourceHttpRequestHandler.html
ResourceResolver	A										<section class="prog__container">A strategy for resolving a request to a server-side resource.

ResourceUrlEncodingFilter	A										<section class="prog__container">A filter that wraps the HttpServletResponse and overrides its encodeURL method in order to translate internal resource request URLs into public URL paths for external use.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/resource/ResourceUrlEncodingFilter.html
ResourceUrlProvider	A										<section class="prog__container">A central component to use to obtain the public URL path that clients should use to access a static resource. This class is aware of Spring MVC handler mappings used to serve static resources and uses the ResourceResolver chains of the configured ResourceHttpRequestHandlers to make its decisions.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/resource/ResourceUrlProvider.html
ResourceUrlProviderExposingInterceptor	A										<section class="prog__container">An interceptor that exposes the ResourceUrlProvider instance it is configured with as a request attribute.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/resource/ResourceUrlProviderExposingInterceptor.html

VersionPathStrategy	A										<section class="prog__container">A strategy for extracting and embedding a resource version in its URL path.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/resource/VersionPathStrategy.html
VersionResourceResolver	A										<section class="prog__container">Resolves request paths containing a version string that can be used as part of an HTTP caching strategy in which a resource is cached with a date in the distant future (e.g. 1 year) and cached until the version, and therefore the URL, is changed. Different versioning strategies exist, and this resolver must be configured with one or more such strategies along with path mappings to indicate which strategy applies to which resources. ContentVersionStrategy is a good default choice except in cases where it cannot be used. Most notably the ContentVersionStrategy cannot be combined with JavaScript module loaders. For such cases the FixedVersionStrategy is a better choice. Note that using this resolver to serve CSS files means that the CssLinkResourceTransformer should also be used in order to modify links within CSS files to also contain the appropriate versions generated by this resolver.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/resource/VersionResourceResolver.html
VersionStrategy	A										<section class="prog__container">An extension of VersionPathStrategy that adds a method to determine the actual version of a Resource.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/resource/VersionStrategy.html
WebJarsResourceResolver	A										<section class="prog__container">A ResourceResolver that delegates to the chain to locate a resource and then attempts to find a matching versioned resource contained in a WebJar JAR file. This allows WebJars.org users to write version agnostic paths in their templates, like <script src="/jquery/jquery.min.js"/>. This path will be resolved to the unique version <script src="/jquery/1.2.0/jquery.min.js"/>, which is a better fit for HTTP caching and version management in applications. This also resolves resources for version agnostic HTTP requests "GET /jquery/jquery.min.js". This resolver requires the "org.webjars:webjars-locator" library on classpath, and is automatically registered if that library is present.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/resource/WebJarsResourceResolver.html
AbstractAnnotationConfigDispatcherServletInitializer	A										<section class="prog__container">Base class for WebApplicationInitializer implementations that register a DispatcherServlet configured with annotated classes, e.g. Spring's @Configuration classes. Concrete implementations are required to implement getRootConfigClasses() and getServletConfigClasses() as well as AbstractDispatcherServletInitializer.getServletMappings(). Further template and customization methods are provided by AbstractDispatcherServletInitializer. This is the preferred approach for applications that use Java-based Spring configuration.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/support/AbstractAnnotationConfigDispatcherServletInitializer.html
AbstractDispatcherServletInitializer	A										<section class="prog__container">Base class for WebApplicationInitializer implementations that register a DispatcherServlet in the servlet context. Concrete implementations are required to implement createServletApplicationContext(), as well as getServletMappings(), both of which get invoked from registerDispatcherServlet(ServletContext). Further customization can be achieved by overriding customizeRegistration(ServletRegistration.Dynamic). Because this class extends from AbstractContextLoaderInitializer, concrete implementations are also required to implement AbstractContextLoaderInitializer.createRootApplicationContext() to set up a parent "root" application context. If a root context is not desired, implementations can simply return null in the createRootApplicationContext() implementation.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/support/AbstractDispatcherServletInitializer.html
AbstractFlashMapManager	A										<section class="prog__container">A base class for FlashMapManager implementations.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/support/AbstractFlashMapManager.html
BindStatus	A										<section class="prog__container">Simple adapter to expose the bind status of a field or object. Set as a variable both by the JSP bind tag and Velocity/FreeMarker macros. Obviously, object status representations (i.e. errors at the object level rather than the field level) do not have an expression and a value but only error codes and messages. For simplicity's sake and to be able to use the same tags and macros, the same status class is used for both scenarios.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/support/BindStatus.html
JspAwareRequestContext	A										<section class="prog__container">JSP-aware (and JSTL-aware) subclass of RequestContext, allowing for population of the context from a javax.servlet.jsp.PageContext. This context will detect a JSTL locale attribute in page/request/session/application scope, in addition to the fallback locale strategy provided by the base class.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/support/JspAwareRequestContext.html
JstlUtils	A										<section class="prog__container">Helper class for preparing JSTL views, in particular for exposing a JSTL localization context.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/support/JstlUtils.html
RequestContext	A										<section class="prog__container">Context holder for request-specific state, like current web application context, current locale, current theme, and potential binding errors. Provides easy access to localized messages and Errors instances. Suitable for exposition to views, and usage within JSP's "useBean" tag, JSP scriptlets, JSTL EL, etc. Necessary for views that do not have access to the servlet request, like FreeMarker templates. Can be instantiated manually, or automatically exposed to views as model attribute via AbstractView's "requestContextAttribute" property. Will also work outside of DispatcherServlet requests, accessing the root WebApplicationContext and using an appropriate fallback for the locale (the HttpServletRequest's primary locale).</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/support/RequestContext.html
RequestContextUtils	A										<section class="prog__container">Utility class for easy access to request-specific state which has been set by the DispatcherServlet. Supports lookup of current WebApplicationContext, LocaleResolver, Locale, ThemeResolver, Theme, and MultipartResolver.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/support/RequestContextUtils.html
RequestDataValueProcessor	A										<section class="prog__container">A contract for inspecting and potentially modifying request data values such as URL query parameters or form field values before they are rendered by a view or before a redirect. Implementations may use this contract for example as part of a solution to provide data integrity, confidentiality, protection against cross-site request forgery (CSRF), and others or for other tasks such as automatically adding a hidden field to all forms and URLs.

Can also be used for custom handlers that have their own HandlerAdapter. Supports HTTP cache control options. The usage of corresponding HTTP headers can be controlled via the "cacheSeconds" and "cacheControl" properties. NOTE: As of Spring 4.2, this generator's default behavior changed when using only setCacheSeconds(int), sending HTTP response headers that are in line with current browsers and proxies implementations (i.e. no HTTP 1.0 headers anymore) Reverting to the previous behavior can be easily done by using one of the newly deprecated methods setUseExpiresHeader(boolean), setUseCacheControlHeader(boolean), setUseCacheControlNoStore(boolean) or setAlwaysMustRevalidate(boolean).</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/support/WebContentGenerator.html

BindTag	A										<section class="prog__container">Bind tag, supporting evaluation of binding errors for a certain bean or bean property. Exposes a "status" variable of type BindStatus, to both Java expressions and JSP EL expressions. Can be used to bind to any bean or bean property in the model. The specified path determines whether the tag exposes the status of the bean itself (showing object-level errors), a specific bean property (showing field errors), or a matching set of bean properties (showing all corresponding field errors). The Errors object that has been bound using this tag is exposed to collaborating tags, as well as the bean property that this errors object applies to. Nested tags such as the TransformTag can access those exposed properties.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/tags/BindTag.html

NestedPathTag	A										<section class="prog__container">Nested-path tag, to support and assist with nested beans or bean properties in the model. Exports a "nestedPath" variable of type String in request scope, visible to the current page and also included pages, if any. The BindTag will auto-detect the current nested path and automatically prepend it to its own path to form a complete path to the bean or bean property. This tag will also prepend any existing nested path that is currently set. Thus, you can nest multiple nested-path tags.

This tag uses that PropertyEditor to transform objects passed into this tag.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/tags/TransformTag.html
UrlTag	A										<section class="prog__container">JSP tag for creating URLs. Modeled after the JSTL c:url tag with backwards compatibility in mind. Enhancements to the JSTL functionality include: URL encoded template URI variablesHTML/XML escaping of URLsJavaScript escaping of URLsTemplate URI variables are indicated in the 'value' attribute and marked by braces '{variableName}'. The braces and attribute name are replaced by the URL encoded value of a parameter defined with the spring:param tag in the body of the url tag. If no parameter is available the literal value is passed through. Params matched to template variables will not be added to the query string. Use of the spring:param tag for URI template variables is strongly recommended over direct EL substitution as the values are URL encoded.  Failure to properly encode URL can leave an application vulnerable to XSS and other injection attacks. URLs can be HTML/XML escaped by setting the 'htmlEscape' attribute to 'true'.  Detects an HTML escaping setting, either on this tag instance, the page level, or the web.xml level. The default is 'false'.  When setting the URL value into a variable, escaping is not recommended. Example usage: <spring:url value="/url/path/{variableName}">   <spring:param name="variableName" value="more than JSTL c:url" /> </spring:url> Results in: /currentApplicationContext/url/path/more%20than%20JSTL%20c%3Aurl</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/tags/UrlTag.html

Subclasses should be JavaBeans, to allow for convenient configuration as Spring-managed bean instances. Provides support for static attributes, to be made available to the view, with a variety of ways to specify them. Static attributes will be merged with the given dynamic attributes (the model that the controller returned) for each render operation. Extends WebApplicationObjectSupport, which will be helpful to some views. Subclasses just need to implement the actual rendering.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/view/AbstractView.html
BeanNameViewResolver	A										<section class="prog__container">A simple implementation of ViewResolver that interprets a view name as a bean name in the current application context, i.e. typically in the XML file of the executing DispatcherServlet. This resolver can be handy for small applications, keeping all definitions ranging from controllers to views in the same place. For larger applications, XmlViewResolver will be the better choice, as it separates the XML view bean definitions into a dedicated views file. Note: Neither this ViewResolver nor XmlViewResolver supports internationalization. Consider ResourceBundleViewResolver if you need to apply different view resources per locale. Note: This ViewResolver implements the Ordered interface in order to allow for flexible participation in ViewResolver chaining. For example, some special views could be defined via this ViewResolver (giving it 0 as "order" value), while all remaining views could be resolved by a UrlBasedViewResolver.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/view/BeanNameViewResolver.html
ContentNegotiatingViewResolver	A										<section class="prog__container">Implementation of ViewResolver that resolves a view based on the request file name or Accept header. The ContentNegotiatingViewResolver does not resolve views itself, but delegates to other ViewResolvers. By default, these other view resolvers are picked up automatically from the application context, though they can also be set explicitly by using the viewResolvers property. Note that in order for this view resolver to work properly, the order property needs to be set to a higher precedence than the others (the default is Ordered.HIGHEST_PRECEDENCE). This view resolver uses the requested media type to select a suitable View for a request. The requested media type is determined through the configured ContentNegotiationManager. Once the requested media type has been determined, this resolver queries each delegate view resolver for a View and determines if the requested media type is compatible with the view's content type). The most compatible view is returned. Additionally, this view resolver exposes the defaultViews property, allowing you to override the views provided by the view resolvers. Note that these default views are offered as candidates, and still need have the content type requested (via file extension, parameter, or Accept header, described above). For example, if the request path is /view.html, this view resolver will look for a view that has the text/html content type (based on the html file extension). A request for /view with a text/html request Accept header has the same result.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/view/ContentNegotiatingViewResolver.html
DefaultRequestToViewNameTranslator	A										<section class="prog__container">RequestToViewNameTranslator that simply transforms the URI of the incoming request into a view name. Can be explicitly defined as the viewNameTranslator bean in a DispatcherServlet context. Otherwise, a plain default instance will be used. The default transformation simply strips leading and trailing slashes as well as the file extension of the URI, and returns the result as the view name with the configured prefix and a suffix added as appropriate. The stripping of the leading slash and file extension can be disabled using the stripLeadingSlash and stripExtension properties, respectively. Find below some examples of request to view name translation. http://localhost:8080/gamecast/display.html » displayhttp://localhost:8080/gamecast/displayShoppingCart.html » displayShoppingCarthttp://localhost:8080/gamecast/admin/index.html » admin/index</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/view/DefaultRequestToViewNameTranslator.html
InternalResourceView	A										<section class="prog__container">Wrapper for a JSP or other resource within the same web application. Exposes model objects as request attributes and forwards the request to the specified resource URL using a RequestDispatcher. A URL for this view is supposed to specify a resource within the web application, suitable for RequestDispatcher's forward or include method. If operating within an already included request or within a response that has already been committed, this view will fall back to an include instead of a forward. This can be enforced by calling response.flushBuffer() (which will commit the response) before rendering the view. Typical usage with InternalResourceViewResolver looks as follows, from the perspective of the DispatcherServlet context definition: <bean id="viewResolver" class="org.springframework.web.servlet.view.InternalResourceViewResolver">   <property name="prefix" value="/WEB-INF/jsp/"/>   <property name="suffix" value=".jsp"/> </bean> Every view name returned from a handler will be translated to a JSP resource (for example: "myView" -> "/WEB-INF/jsp/myView.jsp"), using this view class by default.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/view/InternalResourceView.html
InternalResourceViewResolver	A										<section class="prog__container">Convenient subclass of UrlBasedViewResolver that supports InternalResourceView (i.e. Servlets and JSPs) and subclasses such as JstlView. The view class for all views generated by this resolver can be specified via UrlBasedViewResolver.setViewClass(java.lang.Class<?>). See UrlBasedViewResolver's javadoc for details. The default is InternalResourceView, or JstlView if the JSTL API is present. BTW, it's good practice to put JSP files that just serve as views under WEB-INF, to hide them from direct access (e.g. via a manually entered URL). Only controllers will be able to access them then. Note: When chaining ViewResolvers, an InternalResourceViewResolver always needs to be last, as it will attempt to resolve any view name, no matter whether the underlying resource actually exists.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/view/InternalResourceViewResolver.html
JstlView	A										<section class="prog__container">Specialization of InternalResourceView for JSTL pages, i.e. JSP pages that use the JSP Standard Tag Library. Exposes JSTL-specific request attributes specifying locale and resource bundle for JSTL's formatting and message tags, using Spring's locale and MessageSource. Typical usage with InternalResourceViewResolver would look as follows, from the perspective of the DispatcherServlet context definition:  <bean id="viewResolver" class="org.springframework.web.servlet.view.InternalResourceViewResolver">   <property name="viewClass" value="org.springframework.web.servlet.view.JstlView"/>   <property name="prefix" value="/WEB-INF/jsp/"/>   <property name="suffix" value=".jsp"/> </bean> <bean id="messageSource" class="org.springframework.context.support.ResourceBundleMessageSource">   <property name="basename" value="messages"/> </bean> Every view name returned from a handler will be translated to a JSP resource (for example: "myView" -> "/WEB-INF/jsp/myView.jsp"), using this view class to enable explicit JSTL support. The specified MessageSource loads messages from "messages.properties" etc files in the class path. This will automatically be exposed to views as JSTL localization context, which the JSTL fmt tags (message etc) will use. Consider using Spring's ReloadableResourceBundleMessageSource instead of the standard ResourceBundleMessageSource for more sophistication. Of course, any other Spring components can share the same MessageSource. This is a separate class mainly to avoid JSTL dependencies in InternalResourceView itself. JSTL has not been part of standard J2EE up until J2EE 1.4, so we can't assume the JSTL API jar to be available on the class path. Hint: Set the AbstractView.setExposeContextBeansAsAttributes(boolean) flag to "true" in order to make all Spring beans in the application context accessible within JSTL expressions (e.g. in a c:out value expression). This will also make all such beans accessible in plain ${...} expressions in a JSP 2.0 page.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/view/JstlView.html
RedirectView	A										<section class="prog__container">View that redirects to an absolute, context relative, or current request relative URL. The URL may be a URI template in which case the URI template variables will be replaced with values available in the model. By default all primitive model attributes (or collections thereof) are exposed as HTTP query parameters (assuming they've not been used as URI template variables), but this behavior can be changed by overriding the isEligibleProperty(String, Object) method. A URL for this view is supposed to be a HTTP redirect URL, i.e. suitable for HttpServletResponse's sendRedirect method, which is what actually does the redirect if the HTTP 1.0 flag is on, or via sending back an HTTP 303 code - if the HTTP 1.0 compatibility flag is off. Note that while the default value for the "contextRelative" flag is off, you will probably want to almost always set it to true. With the flag off, URLs starting with "/" are considered relative to the web server root, while with the flag on, they are considered relative to the web application root. Since most web applications will never know or care what their context path actually is, they are much better off setting this flag to true, and submitting paths which are to be considered relative to the web application root. NOTE when using this redirect view in a Portlet environment: Make sure that your controller respects the Portlet sendRedirect constraints.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/view/RedirectView.html
ResourceBundleViewResolver	A										<section class="prog__container">A ViewResolver implementation that uses bean definitions in a ResourceBundle, specified by the bundle basename. The bundle is typically defined in a properties file, located in the classpath. The default bundle basename is "views". This ViewResolver supports localized view definitions, using the default support of PropertyResourceBundle. For example, the basename "views" will be resolved as class path resources "views_de_AT.properties", "views_de.properties", "views.properties" - for a given Locale "de_AT". Note: This ViewResolver implements the Ordered interface in order to allow for flexible participation in ViewResolver chaining. For example, some special views could be defined via this ViewResolver (giving it 0 as "order" value), while all remaining views could be resolved by a UrlBasedViewResolver.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/view/ResourceBundleViewResolver.html
UrlBasedViewResolver	A										<section class="prog__container">Simple implementation of the ViewResolver interface, allowing for direct resolution of symbolic view names to URLs, without explicit mapping definition. This is useful if your symbolic names match the names of your view resources in a straightforward manner (i.e. the symbolic name is the unique part of the resource's filename), without the need for a dedicated mapping to be defined for each view. Supports AbstractUrlBasedView subclasses like InternalResourceView, VelocityView and FreeMarkerView. The view class for all views generated by this resolver can be specified via the "viewClass" property. View names can either be resource URLs themselves, or get augmented by a specified prefix and/or suffix. Exporting an attribute that holds the RequestContext to all views is explicitly supported. Example: prefix="/WEB-INF/jsp/", suffix=".jsp", viewname="test" -> "/WEB-INF/jsp/test.jsp" As a special feature, redirect URLs can be specified via the "redirect:" prefix. E.g.: "redirect:myAction.do" will trigger a redirect to the given URL, rather than resolution as standard view name. This is typically used for redirecting to a controller URL after finishing a form workflow. Furthermore, forward URLs can be specified via the "forward:" prefix. E.g.: "forward:myAction.do" will trigger a forward to the given URL, rather than resolution as standard view name. This is typically used for controller URLs; it is not supposed to be used for JSP URLs - use logical view names there. Note: This class does not support localized resolution, i.e. resolving a symbolic view name to different resources depending on the current locale. Note: When chaining ViewResolvers, a UrlBasedViewResolver will check whether the specified resource actually exists. However, with InternalResourceView, it is not generally possible to determine the existence of the target resource upfront. In such a scenario, a UrlBasedViewResolver will always return View for any given view name; as a consequence, it should be configured as the last ViewResolver in the chain.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/view/UrlBasedViewResolver.html
ViewResolverComposite	A										<section class="prog__container">A ViewResolver that delegates to others.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/view/ViewResolverComposite.html
XmlViewResolver	A										<section class="prog__container">A ViewResolver implementation that uses bean definitions in a dedicated XML file for view definitions, specified by resource location. The file will typically be located in the WEB-INF directory; the default is "/WEB-INF/views.xml". This ViewResolver does not support internationalization at the level of its definition resources. Consider ResourceBundleViewResolver if you need to apply different view resources per locale. Note: This ViewResolver implements the Ordered interface in order to allow for flexible participation in ViewResolver chaining. For example, some special views could be defined via this ViewResolver (giving it 0 as "order" value), while all remaining views could be resolved by a UrlBasedViewResolver.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/view/XmlViewResolver.html

FreeMarkerConfigurer	A										<section class="prog__container">JavaBean to configure FreeMarker for web usage, via the "configLocation" and/or "freemarkerSettings" and/or "templateLoaderPath" properties. The simplest way to use this class is to specify just a "templateLoaderPath"; you do not need any further configuration then.  <bean id="freemarkerConfig" class="org.springframework.web.servlet.view.freemarker.FreeMarkerConfigurer">   <property name="templateLoaderPath"><value>/WEB-INF/freemarker/</value></property> </bean> This bean must be included in the application context of any application using Spring's FreeMarkerView for web MVC. It exists purely to configure FreeMarker. It is not meant to be referenced by application components but just internally by FreeMarkerView. Implements FreeMarkerConfig to be found by FreeMarkerView without depending on the bean name the configurer. Each DispatcherServlet can define its own FreeMarkerConfigurer if desired. Note that you can also refer to a preconfigured FreeMarker Configuration instance, for example one set up by FreeMarkerConfigurationFactoryBean, via the "configuration" property. This allows to share a FreeMarker Configuration for web and email usage, for example. This configurer registers a template loader for this package, allowing to reference the "spring.ftl" macro library (contained in this package and thus in spring.jar) like this:  <#import "/spring.ftl" as spring/> <@spring.bind "person.age"/> age is ${spring.status.value} Note: Spring's FreeMarker support requires FreeMarker 2.3 or higher.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/view/freemarker/FreeMarkerConfigurer.html

Detected and used by GroovyMarkupView.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/view/groovy/GroovyMarkupConfig.html
GroovyMarkupConfigurer	A										<section class="prog__container">An extension of Groovy's TemplateConfiguration and an implementation of Spring MVC's GroovyMarkupConfig for creating a MarkupTemplateEngine for use in a web application. The most basic way to configure this class is to set the "resourceLoaderPath". For example:  // Add the following to an @Configuration class @Bean public GroovyMarkupConfig groovyMarkupConfigurer() {     GroovyMarkupConfigurer configurer = new GroovyMarkupConfigurer();     configurer.setResourceLoaderPath("classpath:/WEB-INF/groovymarkup/");     return configurer; }  By default this bean will create a MarkupTemplateEngine with: a parent ClassLoader for loading Groovy templates with their references the default configuration in the base class TemplateConfigurationa TemplateResolver for resolving template files  You can provide the MarkupTemplateEngine instance directly to this bean in which case all other properties will not be effectively ignored. This bean must be included in the application context of any application using the Spring MVC GroovyMarkupView for rendering. It exists purely for the purpose of configuring Groovy's Markup templates. It is not meant to be referenced by application components directly. It implements GroovyMarkupConfig to be found by GroovyMarkupView without depending on a bean name. Each DispatcherServlet can define its own GroovyMarkupConfigurer if desired. Note that resource caching is enabled by default in MarkupTemplateEngine. Use the TemplateConfiguration.setCacheTemplates(boolean) to configure that as necessary. Spring's Groovy Markup template support requires Groovy 2.3.1 or higher.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/view/groovy/GroovyMarkupConfigurer.html

AbstractJasperReportsSingleFormatView	A										<section class="prog__container">Extends AbstractJasperReportsView to provide basic rendering logic for views that use a fixed format, e.g. always PDF or always HTML. Subclasses need to implement two template methods: createExporter to create a JasperReports exporter for a specific output format, and useWriter to determine whether to write text or binary content. This class is compatible with classic JasperReports releases back until 2.x. As a consequence, it keeps using the JRExporter API which got deprecated as of JasperReports 5.5.2 (early 2014).</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/view/jasperreports/AbstractJasperReportsSingleFormatView.html
AbstractJasperReportsView	A										<section class="prog__container">Base class for all JasperReports views. Applies on-the-fly compilation of report designs as required and coordinates the rendering process. The resource path of the main report needs to be specified as url. This class is responsible for getting report data from the model that has been provided to the view. The default implementation checks for a model object under the specified reportDataKey first, then falls back to looking for a value of type JRDataSource, java.util.Collection, object array (in that order). If no JRDataSource can be found in the model, then reports will be filled using the configured javax.sql.DataSource if any. If neither a JRDataSource or javax.sql.DataSource is available then an IllegalArgumentException is raised. Provides support for sub-reports through the subReportUrls and subReportDataKeys properties. When using sub-reports, the master report should be configured using the url property and the sub-reports files should be configured using the subReportUrls property. Each entry in the subReportUrls Map corresponds to an individual sub-report. The key of an entry must match up to a sub-report parameter in your report file of type net.sf.jasperreports.engine.JasperReport, and the value of an entry must be the URL for the sub-report file. For sub-reports that require an instance of JRDataSource, that is, they don't have a hard-coded query for data retrieval, you can include the appropriate data in your model as would with the data source for the parent report. However, you must provide a List of parameter names that need to be converted to JRDataSource instances for the sub-report via the subReportDataKeys property. When using JRDataSource instances for sub-reports, you must specify a value for the reportDataKey property, indicating the data to use for the main report. Allows for exporter parameters to be configured declatively using the exporterParameters property. This is a Map typed property where the key of an entry corresponds to the fully-qualified name of the static field for the JRExporterParameter and the value of an entry is the value you want to assign to the exporter parameter. Response headers can be controlled via the headers property. Spring will attempt to set the correct value for the Content-Diposition header so that reports render correctly in Internet Explorer. However, you can override this setting through the headers property. This class is compatible with classic JasperReports releases back until 2.x. As a consequence, it keeps using the JRExporter API which got deprecated as of JasperReports 5.5.2 (early 2014).</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/view/jasperreports/AbstractJasperReportsView.html

JasperReportsMultiFormatView	A										<section class="prog__container">JasperReports view class that allows for the actual rendering format to be specified at runtime using a parameter contained in the model. This view works on the concept of a format key and a mapping key. The format key is used to pass the mapping key from your Controller to Spring through as part of the model and the mapping key is used to map a logical format to an actual JasperReports view class. For example, you might add the following code to your Controller:  Map model = new HashMap(); model.put("format", "pdf"); Here format is the format key and pdf is the mapping key. When rendering a report, this class looks for a model parameter under the format key, which by default is format. It then uses the value of this parameter to lookup the actual View class to use. The default mappings for the format lookup are: csv - JasperReportsCsvViewhtml - JasperReportsHtmlViewpdf - JasperReportsPdfViewxls - JasperReportsXlsViewxlsx - JasperReportsXlsxView (as of Spring 4.2) The format key can be changed using the formatKey property. The applicable key-to-view-class mappings can be configured using the formatMappings property.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/view/jasperreports/JasperReportsMultiFormatView.html

TilesConfigurer	A										<section class="prog__container">Helper class to configure Tiles 3.x for the Spring Framework. See http://tiles.apache.org for more information about Tiles, which basically is a templating mechanism for web applications using JSPs and other template engines. The TilesConfigurer simply configures a TilesContainer using a set of files containing definitions, to be accessed by TilesView instances. This is a Spring-based alternative (for usage in Spring configuration) to the Tiles-provided ServletContextListener (e.g. CompleteAutoloadTilesListener for usage in web.xml. TilesViews can be managed by any ViewResolver. For simple convention-based view resolution, consider using TilesViewResolver. A typical TilesConfigurer bean definition looks as follows:  <bean id="tilesConfigurer" class="org.springframework.web.servlet.view.tiles3.TilesConfigurer">   <property name="definitions">     <list>       <value>/WEB-INF/defs/general.xml</value>       <value>/WEB-INF/defs/widgets.xml</value>       <value>/WEB-INF/defs/administrator.xml</value>       <value>/WEB-INF/defs/customer.xml</value>       <value>/WEB-INF/defs/templates.xml</value>     </list>   </property> </bean>  The values in the list are the actual Tiles XML files containing the definitions. If the list is not specified, the default is "/WEB-INF/tiles.xml". Note that in Tiles 3 an underscore in the name of a file containing Tiles definitions is used to indicate locale information, for example:  <bean id="tilesConfigurer" class="org.springframework.web.servlet.view.tiles3.TilesConfigurer">   <property name="definitions">     <list>       <value>/WEB-INF/defs/tiles.xml</value>       <value>/WEB-INF/defs/tiles_fr_FR.xml</value>     </list>   </property> </bean> </section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/view/tiles3/TilesConfigurer.html

ConvertingEncoderDecoderSupport	A										<section class="prog__container">Base class that can be used to implement a standard Encoder and/or Decoder. It provides encode and decode method implementations that delegate to a Spring ConversionService. By default, this class looks up a ConversionService registered in the active ApplicationContext under the name 'webSocketConversionService'. This works fine for both client and server endpoints, in a Servlet container environment. If not running in a Servlet container, subclasses will need to override the getConversionService() method to provide an alternative lookup strategy. Subclasses can extend this class and should also implement one or both of Encoder and Decoder. For convenience ConvertingEncoderDecoderSupport.BinaryEncoder, ConvertingEncoderDecoderSupport.BinaryDecoder, ConvertingEncoderDecoderSupport.TextEncoder and ConvertingEncoderDecoderSupport.TextDecoder subclasses are provided. Since JSR-356 only allows Encoder/Decoder to be registered by type, instances of this class are therefore managed by the WebSocket runtime, and do not need to be registered as Spring Beans. They can, however, by injected with Spring-managed dependencies via @Autowire. Converters to convert between the type and String or ByteBuffer should be registered.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/socket/adapter/standard/ConvertingEncoderDecoderSupport.html

Reference: http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/charset.htmlFor a comprehensive set of String escaping utilities, consider Apache Commons Lang and its StringEscapeUtils class. We are not using that class here to avoid a runtime dependency on Commons Lang just for HTML escaping. Furthermore, Spring's HTML escaping is more flexible and 100% HTML 4.0 compliant.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/util/HtmlUtils.html
HttpSessionMutexListener	A										<section class="prog__container">Servlet HttpSessionListener that automatically exposes the session mutex when an HttpSession gets created. To be registered as a listener in web.xml. The session mutex is guaranteed to be the same object during the entire lifetime of the session, available under the key defined by the SESSION_MUTEX_ATTRIBUTE constant. It serves as a safe reference to synchronize on for locking on the current session. In many cases, the HttpSession reference itself is a safe mutex as well, since it will always be the same object reference for the same active logical session. However, this is not guaranteed across different servlet containers; the only 100% safe way is a session mutex.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/util/HttpSessionMutexListener.html
IntrospectorCleanupListener	A										<section class="prog__container">Listener that flushes the JDK's JavaBeans Introspector cache on web app shutdown. Register this listener in your web.xml to guarantee proper release of the web application class loader and its loaded classes. If the JavaBeans Introspector has been used to analyze application classes, the system-level Introspector cache will hold a hard reference to those classes. Consequently, those classes and the web application class loader will not be garbage-collected on web app shutdown! This listener performs proper cleanup, to allow for garbage collection to take effect. Unfortunately, the only way to clean up the Introspector is to flush the entire cache, as there is no way to specifically determine the application's classes referenced there. This will remove cached introspection results for all other applications in the server too. Note that this listener is not necessary when using Spring's beans infrastructure within the application, as Spring's own introspection results cache will immediately flush an analyzed class from the JavaBeans Introspector cache and only hold a cache within the application's own ClassLoader. Although Spring itself does not create JDK Introspector leaks, note that this listener should nevertheless be used in scenarios where the Spring framework classes themselves reside in a 'common' ClassLoader (such as the system ClassLoader). In such a scenario, this listener will properly clean up Spring's introspection cache. Application classes hardly ever need to use the JavaBeans Introspector directly, so are normally not the cause of Introspector resource leaks. Rather, many libraries and frameworks do not clean up the Introspector: e.g. Struts and Quartz. Note that a single such Introspector leak will cause the entire web app class loader to not get garbage collected! This has the consequence that you will see all the application's static class resources (like singletons) around after web app shutdown, which is not the fault of those classes! This listener should be registered as the first one in web.xml, before any application listeners such as Spring's ContextLoaderListener. This allows the listener to take full effect at the right time of the lifecycle.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/util/IntrospectorCleanupListener.html

NestedServletException	A										<section class="prog__container">Subclass of ServletException that properly handles a root cause in terms of message and stacktrace, just like NestedChecked/RuntimeException does. Note that the plain ServletException doesn't expose its root cause at all, neither in the exception message nor in printed stack traces! While this might be fixed in later Servlet API variants (which even differ per vendor for the same API version), it is not reliably available on Servlet 2.4 (the minimum version required by Spring 3.x), which is why we need to do it ourselves. The similarity between this class and the NestedChecked/RuntimeException class is unavoidable, as this class needs to derive from ServletException.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/util/NestedServletException.html
ServletContextPropertyUtils	A										<section class="prog__container">Helper class for resolving placeholders in texts. Usually applied to file paths.

UriComponentsBuilder	A										<section class="prog__container">Builder for UriComponents. Typical usage involves: Create a UriComponentsBuilder with one of the static factory methods (such as fromPath(String) or fromUri(URI))Set the various URI components through the respective methods (scheme(String), userInfo(String), host(String), port(int), path(String), pathSegment(String...), queryParam(String, Object...), and fragment(String).Build the UriComponents instance with the build() method.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/util/UriComponentsBuilder.html
UriTemplate	A										<section class="prog__container">Represents a URI template. A URI template is a URI-like String that contains variables enclosed by braces ({}), which can be expanded to produce an actual URI. See expand(Map), expand(Object[]), and match(String) for example usages.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/util/UriTemplate.html
UriTemplateHandler	A										<section class="prog__container">Strategy for expanding a URI template with full control over the URI template syntax and the encoding of variables. Also a convenient central point for pre-processing all URI templates for example to insert a common base path. Supported as a property on the RestTemplate as well as the AsyncRestTemplate. The DefaultUriTemplateHandler is built on Spring's URI template support via UriComponentsBuilder. An alternative implementation may be used to plug external URI template libraries.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/util/UriTemplateHandler.html
UriUtils	A										<section class="prog__container">Utility class for URI encoding and decoding based on RFC 3986. Offers encoding methods for the various URI components. All encode*(String, String) methods in this class operate in a similar way: Valid characters for the specific URI component as defined in RFC 3986 stay the same.All other characters are converted into one or more bytes in the given encoding scheme. Each of the resulting bytes is written as a hexadecimal string in the "%xy" format.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/util/UriUtils.html
UrlPathHelper	A										<section class="prog__container">Helper class for URL path matching. Provides support for URL paths in RequestDispatcher includes and support for consistent URL decoding. Used by AbstractUrlHandlerMapping, AbstractUrlMethodNameResolver and RequestContext for path matching and/or URI determination.</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/util/UrlPathHelper.html
WebAppRootListener	A										<section class="prog__container">Listener that sets a system property to the web application root directory. The key of the system property can be defined with the "webAppRootKey" init parameter at the servlet context level (i.e. context-param in web.xml), the default key is "webapp.root". Can be used for toolkits that support substitution with system properties (i.e. System.getProperty values), like log4j's "${key}" syntax within log file locations. Note: This listener should be placed before ContextLoaderListener in web.xml, at least when used for log4j. Log4jConfigListener sets the system property implicitly, so there's no need for this listener in addition to it. WARNING: Some containers, e.g. Tomcat, do NOT keep system properties separate per web app. You have to use unique "webAppRootKey" context-params per web app then, to avoid clashes. Other containers like Resin do isolate each web app's system properties: Here you can use the default key (i.e. no "webAppRootKey" context-param at all) without worrying. WARNING: The WAR file containing the web application needs to be expanded to allow for setting the web app root system property. This is by default not the case when a WAR file gets deployed to WebLogic, for example. Do not use this listener in such an environment!</section>	http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/util/WebAppRootListener.html
