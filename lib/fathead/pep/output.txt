While use of nested classes is often considered poor\nstyle, the only reason for them to have second class introspection\nsupport is a lousy pun.\n   </p>\n<p>\n    Python 3 adds insult to injury by dropping what was formerly known as\nunbound methods.  In Python 2, given the following definition:\n   </p>\n<pre><code>\nclass C:\n    def f():\n        pass\n</code></pre>\n<p>\n    you can then walk up from the\n    <code>\n     C.f\n    </code>\n    object to its defining class:\n   </p>\n<pre><code>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; C.f.im_class\n&lt;class \__main__.C\&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>\n    This possibility is gone in Python 3:\n   </p>\n<pre><code>\n&gt;&gt;&gt; C.f.im_class\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;\nAttributeError: \function\ object has no attribute \im_class\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; dir(C.f)\n[\__annotations__\, \__call__\, \__class__\, \__closure__\, \__code__\,\n\__defaults__\, \__delattr__\, \__dict__\, \__dir__\, \__doc__\,\n\__eq__\, \__format__\, \__ge__\, \__get__\, \__getattribute__\,\n\__globals__\, \__gt__\, \__hash__\, \__init__\, \__kwdefaults__\,\n\__le__\, \__lt__\, \__module__\, \__name__\, \__ne__\, \__new__\,\n\__reduce__\, \__reduce_ex__\, \__repr__\, \__setattr__\, \__sizeof__\,\n\__str__\, \__subclasshook__\]\n</code></pre>\n<p>\n    This limits again the introspection capabilities available to the\nuser.

In Python, a standard pattern for handling such cases\nis to store the global state in global or thread-local storage, and\nthen use\n    <code>\n     with\n    </code>\n    blocks to limit modifications of this global state\nto a single dynamic scope. Examples where this pattern is used include\nthe standard library\s\n    <code>\n     warnings.catch_warnings\n    </code>\n    and\n    <code>\n     decimal.localcontext\n    </code>\n    , NumPy\s\n    <code>\n     numpy.errstate\n    </code>\n    (which exposes\nthe error-handling settings provided by the IEEE 754 floating point\nstandard), and the handling of logging context or HTTP request context\nin many server application frameworks.\n   </p>\n<p>\n    However, there is currently no ergonomic way to manage such local\nchanges to global state when writing a generator or coroutine. For\nexample, this code:\n   </p>\n<pre><code>\ndef f():\n    with warnings.catch_warnings():\n        for x in g():\n            yield x\n</code></pre>\n<p>\n    may or may not successfully catch warnings raised by\n    <code>\n     g()\n    </code>\n    , and may\nor may not inadverdantly swallow warnings triggered elsewhere in the\ncode.  The context manager, which was intended to apply only to\n    <code>\n     f\n    </code>\n    and its callees, ends up having a dynamic scope that encompasses\narbitrary and unpredictable parts of its call\n    <strong>\n     ers\n    </strong>\n    . This problem\nbecomes particularly acute when writing asynchronous code, where\nessentially all functions become coroutines.\n   </p>\n<p>\n    Here, we propose to solve this problem by notifying context managers\nwhenever execution is suspended or resumed within their scope,\nallowing them to restrict their effects appropriately.\n   </p>\n</p>\n</section>	https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0521/

This did not seem the right approach to me.\n   </p>\n<p>\n    Jeffrey Yasskin, with the help of Adam Hupp, then prepared a patch to\nmake the bytes type immutable (by crudely removing all mutating APIs)\nand fix the fall-out in the test suite.  This showed that there aren\t\nall that many places that depend on the mutability of bytes, with the\nexception of code that builds up a return value from small pieces.\n   </p>\n<p>\n    Thinking through the consequences, and noticing that using the array\nmodule as an ersatz mutable bytes type is far from ideal, and\nrecalling a proposal put forward earlier by Talin, I floated the\nsuggestion to have both a mutable and an immutable bytes type.  (This\nhad been brought up before, but until seeing the evidence of Jeffrey\s\npatch I wasn\t open to the suggestion.)\n   </p>\n<p>\n    Moreover, a possible implementation strategy became clear: use the old\nPyString implementation, stripped down to remove locale support and\nimplicit conversions to/from Unicode, for the immutable bytes type,\nand keep the new PyBytes implementation as the mutable bytes type.\n   </p>\n<p>\n    The ensuing discussion made it clear that the idea is welcome but\nneeds to be specified more precisely.

The goal is to solve\nimport-related problems by bringing extension modules closer to the way Python\nmodules behave; specifically to hook into the ModuleSpec-based loading\nmechanism introduced in\n    \n     PEP 451\n    \n    .\n   </p>\n<p>\n    This proposal draws inspiration from PyType_Spec of\n    \n     PEP 384\n    \n    to allow extension\nauthors to only define features they need, and to allow future additions\nto extension module declarations.\n   </p>\n<p>\n    Extensions modules are created in a two-step process, fitting better into\nthe ModuleSpec architecture, with parallels to __new__ and __init__ of classes.\n   </p>\n<p>\n    Extension modules can safely store arbitrary C-level per-module state in\nthe module that is covered by normal garbage collection and supports\nreloading and sub-interpreters.\nExtension authors are encouraged to take these issues into account\nwhen using the new API.\n   </p>\n<p>\n    The proposal also allows extension modules with non-ASCII names.\n   </p>\n<p>\n    Not all problems tackled in\n    \n     PEP 3121\n    \n    are solved in this proposal.\nIn particular, problems with run-time module lookup (PyState_FindModule)\nare left to a future PEP.\n   </p>\n</p>\n</section>	https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0489/

There has now been enough 3rd party\nusage for static type analysis that the community would benefit from\na standard vocabulary and baseline tools within the standard library.\n   </p>\n<p>\n    This PEP introduces a provisional module to provide these standard\ndefinitions and tools, along with some conventions for situations\nwhere annotations are not available.\n   </p>\n<p>\n    Note that this PEP still explicitly does NOT prevent other uses of\nannotations, nor does it require (or forbid) any particular processing\nof annotations, even when they conform to this specification.  It\nsimply enables better coordination, as\n    \n     PEP 333\n    \n    did for web frameworks.\n   </p>\n<p>\n    For example, here is a simple function whose argument and return type\nare declared in the annotations:\n   </p>\n<pre><code>\ndef greeting(name: str) -&gt; str:\n    return \Hello \ + name\n</code></pre>\n<p>\n    While these annotations are available at runtime through the usual\n    <code>\n     __annotations__\n    </code>\n    attribute,\n    <em>\n     no type checking happens at runtime\n    </em>\n    .\nInstead, the proposal assumes the existence of a separate off-line\ntype checker which users can run over their source code voluntarily.\nEssentially, such a type checker acts as a very powerful linter.\n(While it would of course be possible for individual users to employ\na similar checker at run time for Design By Contract enforcement or\nJIT optimization, those tools are not yet as mature.)\n   </p>\n<p>\n    The proposal is strongly inspired by mypy\n    \n     [mypy]\n    \n    .  For example, the\ntype "sequence of integers" can be written as\n    <code>\n     Sequence[int]\n    </code>\n    .  The\nsquare brackets mean that no new syntax needs to be added to the\nlanguage.  The example here uses a custom type\n    <code>\n     Sequence\n    </code>\n    , imported\nfrom a pure-Python module\n    <code>\n     typing\n    </code>\n    .  The\n    <code>\n     Sequence[int]\n    </code>\n    notation\nworks at runtime by implementing\n    <code>\n     __getitem__()\n    </code>\n    in the metaclass\n(but its significance is primarily to an offline type checker).\n   </p>\n<p>\n    The type system supports unions, generic types, and a special type\nnamed\n    <code>\n     Any\n    </code>\n    which is consistent with (i.e. assignable to and from) all\ntypes.  This latter feature is taken from the idea of gradual typing.\nGradual typing and the full type system are explained in\n    \n     PEP 483\n    \n    .\n   </p>\n<p>\n    Other approaches from which we have borrowed or to which ours can be\ncompared and contrasted are described in\n    \n     PEP 482\n    \n    .\n   </p>\n</p>\n</section>	https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/

End-to-end signing allows both PyPI and\ndevelopers to sign for the distributions that are downloaded by clients.  The\nminimum security model proposed by\n    \n     PEP 458\n    \n    supports continuous delivery of\ndistributions (because they are signed by online keys), but that model does not\nprotect distributions in the event that PyPI is compromised.  In the minimum\nsecurity model, attackers may sign for malicious distributions by compromising\nthe signing keys stored on PyPI infrastructure.   The maximum security model,\ndescribed in this PEP, retains the benefits of\n    \n     PEP 458\n    \n    (e.g., immediate\navailability of distributions that are uploaded to PyPI), but additionally\nensures that end-users are not at risk of installing forged software if PyPI is\ncompromised.\n   </p>\n<p>\n    This PEP discusses the changes made to\n    \n     PEP 458\n    \n    but excludes its informational\nelements to primarily focus on the maximum security model.

The changes to\n    \n     PEP 458\n    \n    include modifications to the snapshot\nprocess, key compromise analysis, auditing snapshots, and the steps that should\nbe taken in the event of a PyPI compromise.

Of\ncourse, other syntax for such a statement is possible, but it is hoped\nthat by keeping a strong parallel to the class statement, an\nunderstanding of how classes and metaclasses work will translate into\nan understanding of how the make-statement works as well.\n   </p>\n<p>\n    The PEP is based on a suggestion\n    \n\n    from Michele Simionato on the\npython-dev list.\n   </p>\n</p>\n</section>	https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0359/

TUF was designed to be a flexible\nsecurity add-on to a software updater or package manager.  The framework\nintegrates best security practices such as separating role responsibilities,\nadopting the many-man rule for signing packages, keeping signing keys offline,\nand revocation of expired or compromised signing keys.  For example, attackers\nwould have to steal multiple signing keys stored independently to compromise\na role responsible for specifying a repository\s available files.  Another role\nresponsible for indicating the latest snapshot of the repository may have to be\nsimilarly compromised, and independent of the first compromised role.\n   </p>\n<p>\n    The proposed integration will allow modern package managers such as pip\n    \n\n    to\nbe more secure against various types of security attacks on PyPI and protect\nusers from such attacks.  Specifically, this PEP describes how PyPI processes\nshould be adapted to generate and incorporate TUF metadata (i.e., the minimum\nsecurity model).  The minimum security model supports verification of PyPI\ndistributions that are signed with keys stored on PyPI: distributions uploaded\nby developers are signed by PyPI, require no action from developers (other than\nuploading the distribution), and are immediately available for download.  The\nminimum security model also minimizes PyPI administrative responsibilities by\nautomating much of the signing process.\n   </p>\n<p>\n    This PEP does not prescribe how package managers such as pip should be adapted\nto install or update projects from PyPI with TUF metadata.   Package managers\ninterested in adopting TUF on the client side may consult TUF\s\n    \n     library\ndocumentation\n    \n\n\n    , which exists for this purpose.  Support for project\ndistributions that are signed by developers (maximum security model) is also\nnot discussed in this PEP, but is outlined in the appendix as a possible future\nextension and covered in detail in\n    \n     PEP 480\n    \n\n\n    .  The\n    \n     PEP 480\n    \n    extension\nfocuses on the maximum security model, which requires more PyPI administrative\nwork (none by clients), but it also proposes an easy-to-use key management\nsolution for developers, how to interface with a potential future build farm on\nPyPI infrastructure, and discusses the feasibility of end-to-end signing.\n   </p>\n</p>\n</section>	https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0458/

Class\nattributes defined there are thus ordered.  Aside from helping with\nreadability, that ordering is sometimes significant.  If it were\nautomatically available outside the class definition then the\nattribute order could be used without the need for extra boilerplate\n(such as metaclasses or manually enumerating the attribute order).\nGiven that this information already exists, access to the definition\norder of attributes is a reasonable expectation.  However, currently\nPython does not preserve the attribute order from the class\ndefinition.\n   </p>\n<p>\n    This PEP changes that by preserving the order in which attributes\nare introduced in the class definition body.  That order will now be\npreserved in the\n    <code>\n     __definition_order__\n    </code>\n    attribute of the class.\nThis allows introspection of the original definition order, e.g. by\nclass decorators.\n   </p>\n<p>\n    Additionally, this PEP requires that the default class definition\nnamespace be ordered (e.g.\n    <code>\n     OrderedDict\n    </code>\n    ) by default.

PEP 374	A										<section class="prog__container">\n<span class="prog__sub">Title</span>\n<p>PEP 374 - Choosing a distributed VCS for the Python project</p>\n<span class="prog__sub">Description</span>\n<p>\n<p>\n    Python has been using a centralized version control system (VCS;\nfirst CVS, now Subversion) for years to great effect. Having a master\ncopy of the official version of Python provides people with a single\nplace to always get the official Python source code. It has also\nallowed for the storage of the history of the language, mostly for\nhelp with development, but also for posterity. And of course the V in\nVCS is very helpful when developing.\n   </p>\n<p>\n    But a centralized version control system has its drawbacks. First and\nforemost, in order to have the benefits of version control with\nPython in a seamless fashion, one must be a "core developer" (i.e.\nsomeone with commit privileges on the master copy of Python). People\nwho are not core developers but who wish to work with Python\s\nrevision tree, e.g. anyone writing a patch for Python or creating a\ncustom version, do not have direct tool support for revisions. This\ncan be quite a limitation, since these non-core developers cannot\neasily do basic tasks such as reverting changes to a previously\nsaved state, creating branches, publishing one\s changes with full\nrevision history, etc. For non-core developers, the last safe tree\nstate is one the Python developers happen to set, and this prevents\nsafe development. This second-class citizenship is a hindrance to\npeople who wish to contribute to Python with a patch of any\ncomplexity and want a way to incrementally save their progress to\nmake their development lives easier.\n   </p>\n<p>\n    There is also the issue of having to be online to be able to commit\none\s work. Because centralized VCSs keep a central copy that stores\nall revisions, one must have Internet access in order for their\nrevisions to be stored; no Net, no commit. This can be annoying if\nyou happen to be traveling and lack any Internet. There is also the\nsituation of someone wishing to contribute to Python but having a\nbad Internet connection where committing is time-consuming and\nexpensive and it might work out better to do it in a single step.\n   </p>\n<p>\n    Another drawback to a centralized VCS is that a common use case is\nfor a developer to revise patches in response to review comments.\nThis is more difficult with a centralized model because there\s no\nplace to contain intermediate work. It\s either all checked in or\nnone of it is checked in. In the centralized VCS, it\s also very\ndifficult to track changes to the trunk as they are committed, while\nyou\re working on your feature or bug fix branch. This increases\nthe risk that such branches will grow stale, out-dated, or that\nmerging them into the trunk will generate too may conflicts to be\neasily resolved.\n   </p>\n<p>\n    Lastly, there is the issue of maintenance of Python. At any one time\nthere is at least one major version of Python under development (at\nthe time of this writing there are two). For each major version of\nPython under development there is at least the maintenance version\nof the last minor version and the in-development minor version (e.g.\nwith 2.6 just released, that means that both 2.6 and 2.7 are being\nworked on). Once a release is done, a branch is created between the\ncode bases where changes in one version do not (but could) belong in\nthe other version. As of right now there is no natural support for\nthis branch in time in central VCSs; you must use tools that\nsimulate the branching. Tracking merges is similarly painful for\ndevelopers, as revisions often need to be merged between four active\nbranches (e.g. 2.6 maintenance, 3.0 maintenance, 2.7 development,\n3.1 development). In this case, VCSs such as Subversion only handle\nthis through arcane third party tools.\n   </p>\n<p>\n    Distributed VCSs (DVCSs) solve all of these problems. While one can\nkeep a master copy of a revision tree, anyone is free to copy that\ntree for their own use. This gives everyone the power to commit\nchanges to their copy, online or offline. It also more naturally\nties into the idea of branching in the history of a revision tree\nfor maintenance and the development of new features bound for\nPython. DVCSs also provide a great many additional features that\ncentralized VCSs don\t or can\t provide.\n   </p>\n<p>\n    This PEP explores the possibility of changing Python\s use of Subversion\nto any of the currently popular  DVCSs, in order to gain\nthe benefits outlined above. This PEP does not guarantee that a switch\nto a DVCS will occur at the conclusion of this PEP. It is quite\npossible that no clear winner will be found and that svn will continue\nto be used. If this happens, this PEP will be revisited and revised in\nthe future as the state of DVCSs evolves.\n   </p>\n</p>\n</section>	https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0374/

Anything that\nprovides\n    <code>\n     read()\n    </code>\n    and\n    <code>\n     write()\n    </code>\n    is stream-like.

Developing a standard definition of a stream lets us\nseparate stream-based operations like\n    <code>\n     read()\n    </code>\n    and\n    <code>\n     write()\n    </code>\n    from\nimplementation specific operations like\n    <code>\n     fileno()\n    </code>\n    and\n    <code>\n     isatty()\n    </code>\n    .\nIt encourages programmers to write code that uses streams as streams\nand not require that all streams support file-specific or\nsocket-specific operations.\n   </p>\n<p>\n    The new I/O spec is intended to be similar to the Java I/O libraries,\nbut generally less confusing.

PEP 352	A										<section class="prog__container">\n<span class="prog__sub">Title</span>\n<p>PEP 352 - Required Superclass for Exceptions</p>\n<span class="prog__sub">Description</span>\n<p>\n<p>\n    In Python 2.4 and before, any (classic) class can be raised as an\nexception.  The plan for 2.5 was to allow new-style classes, but this\nmakes the problem worse -- it would mean\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n    class (or\ninstance) can be raised! This is a problem as it prevents any\nguarantees from being made about the interface of exceptions.\nThis PEP proposes introducing a new superclass that all raised objects\nmust inherit from.  Imposing the restriction will allow a standard\ninterface for exceptions to exist that can be relied upon.  It also\nleads to a known hierarchy for all exceptions to adhere to.\n   </p>\n<p>\n    One might counter that requiring a specific base class for a\nparticular interface is unPythonic.  However, in the specific case of\nexceptions there\s a good reason (which has generally been agreed to\non python-dev): requiring hierarchy helps code that wants to\n    <em>\n     catch\n    </em>\n    exceptions by making it possible to catch\n    <em>\n     all\n    </em>\n    exceptions explicitly\nby writing\n    <code>\n     except BaseException:\n    </code>\n    instead of\n    <code>\n     except *:\n    </code>\n    .\n    \n\n</p>\n<p>\n    Introducing a new superclass for exceptions also gives us the chance\nto rearrange the exception hierarchy slightly for the better.  As it\ncurrently stands, all exceptions in the built-in namespace inherit\nfrom Exception.  This is a problem since this includes two exceptions\n(KeyboardInterrupt and SystemExit) that often need to be excepted from\nthe application\s exception handling: the default behavior of shutting\nthe interpreter down without a traceback is usually more desirable than\nwhatever the application might do (with the possible exception of\napplications that emulate Python\s interactive command loop with\n    <code>\n     &gt;&gt;&gt;\n    </code>\n    prompt).  Changing it so that these two exceptions inherit\nfrom the common superclass instead of Exception will make it easy for\npeople to write\n    <code>\n     except\n    </code>\n    clauses that are not overreaching and not\ncatch exceptions that should propagate up.\n   </p>\n<p>\n    This PEP is based on previous work done for\n    \n     PEP 348\n    \n\n\n    .\n   </p>\n</p>\n</section>	https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0352/

There\s no support for parsing strings in various\nformats and returning a corresponding instance of one of the types.\nThis PEP proposes adding a family of predefined parsing function for\nseveral commonly used date and time formats, and a facility for generic\nparsing.\n   </p>\n<p>\n    The types provided by the\n    <code>\n     datetime\n    </code>\n    module all have\n    <code>\n     .isoformat()\n    </code>\n    and\n    <code>\n     .ctime()\n    </code>\n    methods that return string\nrepresentations of a time, and the\n    <code>\n     .strftime()\n    </code>\n    method can be used\nto construct new formats.  There are a number of additional\ncommonly-used formats that would be useful to have as part of the\nstandard library; this PEP also suggests how to add them.\n   </p>\n</p>\n</section>	https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0321/

PEP 338	A										<section class="prog__container">\n<span class="prog__sub">Title</span>\n<p>PEP 338 - Executing modules as scripts</p>\n<span class="prog__sub">Description</span>\n<p>\n<p>\n    This PEP defines semantics for executing any Python module as a\nscript, either with the\n    <code>\n<span class="pre">\n      -m\n     </span>\n</code>\n    command line switch, or by invoking\nit via\n    <code>\n     runpy.run_module(modulename)\n    </code>\n    .\n   </p>\n<p>\n    The\n    <code>\n<span class="pre">\n      -m\n     </span>\n</code>\n    switch implemented in Python 2.4 is quite limited. This\nPEP proposes making use of the\n    \n     PEP 302\n    \n\n\n    import hooks to allow any\nmodule which provides access to its code object to be executed.\n   </p>\n</p>\n</section>	https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0338/
