For instance, the Scala library defines a value\n scala.collection.immutable.Nil of type List[Nothing]. Because lists are covariant in Scala,\n this makes scala.collection.immutable.Nil an instance of List[T], for any element of type T. Another usage for Nothing is the return type for methods which never return normally.\n One example is method error in scala.sys, which always throws an exception.\n</section>	https://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/Nothing.html

Application	A										<section class="prog_container">The Application trait can be used to quickly turn objects\n into executable programs, but is not recommended.\n Here is an example:object Main extends Application {\nConsole.println("Hello World!")\n} Here, object Main inherits the main method of Application.\n The body of the Main object defines the main program. This technique\n does not work if the main program depends on command-line arguments\n (which are not accessible with the technique presented here). It is possible to time the execution of objects that inherit from class\n Application by setting the global scala.time\n property. Here is an example for benchmarking object Main:java -Dscala.time Main In practice the Application trait has a number of serious pitfalls:Threaded code that references the object will block until static\n   initialization is complete.  However, because the entire execution\n   of an object extending Application takes place during\n   static initialization, concurrent code will always deadlock if\n   it must synchronize with the enclosing object.As described above, there is no way to obtain the\n   command-line arguments because all code in body of an object\n   extending Application is run as part of the static initialization\n   which occurs before Application's main method\n   even begins execution.Static initializers are run only once during program execution, and\n   JVM authors usually assume their execution to be relatively short.\n   Therefore, certain JVM configurations may become confused, or simply\n   fail to optimize or JIT the code in the body of an object extending\n   Application.  This can lead to a significant performance degradation. It is recommended to use the scala.App trait instead.object Main {\ndef main(args: Array[String]) {\n  //..\n}\n}</section>	https://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/Application.html

For instance, the Scala library defines a value\n scala.collection.immutable.Nil of type List[Nothing]. Because lists are covariant in Scala,\n this makes scala.collection.immutable.Nil an instance of List[T], for any element of type T. Another usage for Nothing is the return type for methods which never return normally.\n One example is method error in scala.sys, which always throws an exception.\n</section>	https://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/Nothing.html

Application	A										<section class="prog_container">The Application trait can be used to quickly turn objects\n into executable programs, but is not recommended.\n Here is an example:object Main extends Application {\nConsole.println("Hello World!")\n} Here, object Main inherits the main method of Application.\n The body of the Main object defines the main program. This technique\n does not work if the main program depends on command-line arguments\n (which are not accessible with the technique presented here). It is possible to time the execution of objects that inherit from class\n Application by setting the global scala.time\n property. Here is an example for benchmarking object Main:java -Dscala.time Main In practice the Application trait has a number of serious pitfalls:Threaded code that references the object will block until static\n   initialization is complete.  However, because the entire execution\n   of an object extending Application takes place during\n   static initialization, concurrent code will always deadlock if\n   it must synchronize with the enclosing object.As described above, there is no way to obtain the\n   command-line arguments because all code in body of an object\n   extending Application is run as part of the static initialization\n   which occurs before Application's main method\n   even begins execution.Static initializers are run only once during program execution, and\n   JVM authors usually assume their execution to be relatively short.\n   Therefore, certain JVM configurations may become confused, or simply\n   fail to optimize or JIT the code in the body of an object extending\n   Application.  This can lead to a significant performance degradation. It is recommended to use the scala.App trait instead.object Main {\ndef main(args: Array[String]) {\n  //..\n}\n}</section>	https://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/Application.html
