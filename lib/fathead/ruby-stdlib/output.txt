Benchmark	A	 	 	Ruby Class	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/benchmark/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 The Benchmark module provides methods to measure and report the time used to execute Ruby code.Measure the time to construct the string given by the expression "a"*1_000_000_000:On my machine (OSX 10.8.3 on i5 1.7 GHz) this generates:This report shows the user CPU time, system CPU time, the sum of the user and system CPU times, and the elapsed real time. The unit of time is seconds.Do some experiments sequentially using the bm method:The result:Continuing the previous example, put a label in each report:The result:The times for some benchmarks depend on the order in which items are run.  These differences are due to the cost of memory allocation and garbage collection. To avoid these discrepancies, the bmbm method is provided.  For example, to compare ways to sort an array of floats:The result:Report statistics of sequential experiments with unique labels, using the benchmark method:The result:https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/benchmark/rdoc/Benchmark.html
Benchmark Tms	A	 	 	Ruby Class	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/benchmark/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 A data object, representing the times associated with a benchmark measurement.https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/benchmark/rdoc/Benchmark/Tms.html
benchmark	A	 	 	Ruby Method	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/benchmark/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 Invokes the block with a Benchmark::Report object, which may be used to collect and report on the results of individual benchmark tests. Reserves label_width leading spaces for labels on each line. Prints caption at the top of the report, and uses format to format each line. Returns an array of Benchmark::Tms objects.https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/benchmark/rdoc/Benchmark.html#method-c-benchmark
bm	A	 	 	Ruby Method	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/benchmark/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 A simple interface to the benchmark method, bm generates sequential reports with labels. label_width and labels parameters have the same meaning as for benchmark.https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/benchmark/rdoc/Benchmark.html#method-c-benchmark
bmbm	A	 	 	Ruby Method	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/benchmark/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 Sometimes benchmark results are skewed because code executed earlier encounters different garbage collection overheads than that run later. bmbm attempts to minimize this effect by running the tests twice, the first time as a rehearsal in order to get the runtime environment stable, the second time for real. GC.start is executed before the start of each of the real timings; the cost of this is not included in the timings. In reality, though, there’s only so much that bmbm can do, and the results are not guaranteed to be isolated from garbage collection and other effects.https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/benchmark/rdoc/Benchmark.html#method-c-benchmark

BigDecimal	A	 	 	Ruby Class	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/bigdecimal/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 BigDecimal provides arbitrary-precision floating point decimal arithmetic.Ruby provides built-in support for arbitrary precision integer arithmetic.For example:BigDecimal provides similar support for very large or very accurate floating point numbers.Decimal arithmetic is also useful for general calculation, because it provides the correct answers people expect–whereas normal binary floating point arithmetic often introduces subtle errors because of the conversion between base 10 and base 2.For example, try:and contrast with the output from:Similarly:Because BigDecimal is more accurate than normal binary floating point arithmetic, it requires some special values.BigDecimal sometimes needs to return infinity, for example if you divide a value by zero.You can represent infinite numbers to BigDecimal using the strings 'Infinity', '+Infinity' and '-Infinity' (case-sensitive)When a computation results in an undefined value, the special value NaN (for ‘not a number’) is returned.Example:You can also create undefined values.NaN is never considered to be the same as any other value, even NaN itself:If a computation results in a value which is too small to be represented as a BigDecimal within the currently specified limits of precision, zero must be returned.If the value which is too small to be represented is negative, a BigDecimal value of negative zero is returned.If the value is positive, a value of positive zero is returned.(See ::mode for how to specify limits of precision.)Note that -0.0 and 0.0 are considered to be the same for the purposes of comparison.Note also that in mathematics, there is no particular concept of negative or positive zero; true mathematical zero has no sign.Copyright (C) 2002 by Shigeo Kobayashi <shigeo@tinyforest.gr.jp>.BigDecimal is released under the Ruby and 2-clause BSD licenses.

CGI	A	 	 	Ruby Class	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/cgi/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 The Common Gateway Interface (CGI) is a simple protocol for passing an HTTP request from a web server to a standalone program, and returning the output to the web browser.  Basically, a CGI program is called with the parameters of the request passed in either in the environment (GET) or via $stdin (POST), and everything it prints to $stdout is returned to the client.This file holds the CGI class.  This class provides functionality for retrieving HTTP request parameters, managing cookies, and generating HTML output.The file CGI::Session provides session management functionality; see that class for more details.See www.w3.org/CGI/ for more information on the CGI protocol.CGI is a large class, providing several categories of methods, many of which are mixed in from other modules.  Some of the documentation is in this class, some in the modules CGI::QueryExtension and CGI::HtmlExtension.  See CGI::Cookie for specific information on handling cookies, and cgi/session.rb (CGI::Session) for information on sessions.For queries, CGI provides methods to get at environmental variables, parameters, cookies, and multipart request data.  For responses, CGI provides methods for writing output and generating HTML.Read on for more details.  Examples are provided at the bottom.The CGI class dynamically mixes in parameter and cookie-parsing functionality,  environmental variable access, and support for parsing multipart requests (including uploaded files) from the CGI::QueryExtension module.The standard CGI environmental variables are available as read-only attributes of a CGI object.  The following is a list of these variables:For each of these variables, there is a corresponding attribute with the same name, except all lower case and without a preceding HTTP_. content_length and server_port are integers; the rest are strings.The method params() returns a hash of all parameters in the request as name/value-list pairs, where the value-list is an Array of one or more values.  The CGI object itself also behaves as a hash of parameter names to values, but only returns a single value (as a String) for each parameter name.For instance, suppose the request contains the parameter “favourite_colours” with the multiple values “blue” and “green”.  The following behavior would occur:If a parameter does not exist, the former method will return an empty array, the latter an empty string.  The simplest way to test for existence of a parameter is by the has_key? method.HTTP Cookies are automatically parsed from the request.  They are available from the cookies() accessor, which returns a hash from cookie name to CGI::Cookie object.If a request’s method is POST and its content type is multipart/form-data, then it may contain uploaded files.  These are stored by the QueryExtension module in the parameters of the request.  The parameter name is the name attribute of the file input field, as usual.  However, the value is not a string, but an IO object, either an IOString for small files, or a Tempfile for larger ones.  This object also has the additional singleton methods:the path of the uploaded file on the local filesystemthe name of the file on the client computerthe content type of the fileThe CGI class provides methods for sending header and content output to the HTTP client, and mixes in methods for programmatic HTML generation from CGI::HtmlExtension and CGI::TagMaker modules.  The precise version of HTML to use for HTML generation is specified at object creation time.The simplest way to send output to the HTTP client is using the out() method. This takes the HTTP headers as a hash parameter, and the body content via a block.  The headers can be generated as a string using the http_header() method.  The output stream can be written directly to using the print() method.Each HTML element has a corresponding method for generating that element as a String.  The name of this method is the same as that of the element, all lowercase.  The attributes of the element are passed in as a hash, and the body as a no-argument block that evaluates to a String.  The HTML generation module knows which elements are always empty, and silently drops any passed-in body.  It also knows which elements require matching closing tags and which don’t.  However, it does not know what attributes are legal for which elements.There are also some additional HTML generation methods mixed in from the CGI::HtmlExtension module.  These include individual methods for the different types of form inputs, and methods for elements that commonly take particular attributes where the attributes can be directly specified as arguments, rather than via a hash.There are some utility tool defined in cgi/util.rb . And when include, you can use utility methods like a function.CAUTION! cgi returned an Array with the old cgi.rb(included in Ruby 1.6)cgi.params is a hash.and value has StringIO or Tempfile class methods.and cgi.cookies is a hash.frozen_string_literal: falsefrozen_string_literal: falsefrozen_string_literal: falsehttps://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/cgi/rdoc/CGI.html

CGI Session	A	 	 	Ruby Class	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/cgi/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 This file provides the CGI::Session class, which provides session support for CGI scripts.  A session is a sequence of HTTP requests and responses linked together and associated with a single client. Information associated with the session is stored on the server between requests.  A session id is passed between client and server with every request and response, transparently to the user.  This adds state information to the otherwise stateless HTTP request/response protocol.A CGI::Session instance is created from a CGI object.  By default, this CGI::Session instance will start a new session if none currently exists, or continue the current session for this client if one does exist.  The new_session option can be used to either always or never create a new session.  See new() for more details.delete() deletes a session from session storage.  It does not however remove the session id from the client.  If the client makes another request with the same id, the effect will be to start a new session with the old session's id.The Session class associates data with a session as key-value pairs. This data can be set and retrieved by indexing the Session instance using ‘[]’, much the same as hashes (although other hash methods are not supported).When session processing has been completed for a request, the session should be closed using the close() method.  This will store the session’s state to persistent storage.  If you want to store the session’s state to persistent storage without finishing session processing for this request, call the update() method.The caller can specify what form of storage to use for the session’s data with the database_manager option to ::new.  The following storage classes are provided as part of the standard library:stores data as plain text in a flat file.  Only works with String data.  This is the default storage type.stores data in an in-memory hash.  The data only persists for as long as the current Ruby interpreter instance does.stores data in Marshalled format.  Provided by cgi/session/pstore.rb.  Supports data of any type, and provides file-locking and transaction support.Custom storage types can also be created by defining a class with the following methods:Changing storage type mid-session does not work.  Note in particular that by default the FileStore and PStore session data files have the same name.  If your application switches from one to the other without making sure that filenames will be different and clients still have old sessions lying around in cookies, then things will break nastily!Most session state is maintained on the server.  However, a session id must be passed backwards and forwards between client and server to maintain a reference to this session state.The simplest way to do this is via cookies.  The CGI::Session class provides transparent support for session id communication via cookies if the client has cookies enabled.If the client has cookies disabled, the session id must be included as a parameter of all requests sent by the client to the server.  The CGI::Session class in conjunction with the CGI class will transparently add the session id as a hidden input field to all forms generated using the CGI#form() HTML generation method.  No built-in support is provided for other mechanisms, such as URL re-writing.  The caller is responsible for extracting the session id from the #session_id attribute and manually encoding it in URLs and adding it as a hidden input to HTML forms created by other mechanisms.  Also, session expiry is not automatically handled.https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/cgi/rdoc/CGI/Session.html

CMathTrigonometric and transcendental functions for complex numbers.¶ ↑	A	 	 	Ruby Class	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/cmath/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 frozen_string_literal: falseCMath is a library that provides trigonometric and transcendental functions for complex numbers. The functions in this module accept integers, floating-point numbers or complex numbers as arguments.Note that the selection of functions is similar, but not identical, to that in module math. The reason for having two modules is that some users aren’t interested in complex numbers, and perhaps don’t even know what they are. They would rather have Math.sqrt(-1) raise an exception than return a complex number.For more information you can see Complex class.To start using this library, simply require cmath library:https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/cmath/rdoc/CMath.html

CoverageUsage¶ ↑Example¶ ↑	A	 	 	Ruby Class	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/coverage/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 Coverage provides coverage measurement feature for Ruby. This feature is experimental, so these APIs may be changed in future.require “coverage”do ::startrequire or load Ruby source file::result will return a hash that contains filename as key and coverage array as value. A coverage array gives, for each line, the number of line execution by the interpreter. A nil value means coverage is disabled for this line (lines like else and end).https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/coverage/rdoc/Coverage.html

CSV	A	 	 	Ruby Class	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/csv/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 This class provides a complete interface to CSV files and data.  It offers tools to enable you to read and write to and from Strings or IO objects, as needed.This new CSV parser is m17n savvy.  The parser works in the Encoding of the IO or String object being read from or written to.  Your data is never transcoded (unless you ask Ruby to transcode it for you) and will literally be parsed in the Encoding it is in.  Thus CSV will return Arrays or Rows of Strings in the Encoding of your data.  This is accomplished by transcoding the parser itself into your Encoding.Some transcoding must take place, of course, to accomplish this multiencoding support.  For example, :col_sep, :row_sep, and :quote_char must be transcoded to match your data.  Hopefully this makes the entire process feel transparent, since CSV’s defaults should just magically work for your data.  However, you can set these values manually in the target Encoding to avoid the translation.It’s also important to note that while all of CSV’s core parser is now Encoding agnostic, some features are not.  For example, the built-in converters will try to transcode data to UTF-8 before making conversions. Again, you can provide custom converters that are aware of your Encodings to avoid this translation.  It’s just too hard for me to support native conversions in all of Ruby’s Encodings.Anyway, the practical side of this is simple:  make sure IO and String objects passed into CSV have the proper Encoding set and everything should just work. CSV methods that allow you to open IO objects (CSV::foreach(), ::open, ::read, and ::readlines) do allow you to specify the Encoding.One minor exception comes when generating CSV into a String with an Encoding that is not ASCII compatible.  There’s no existing data for CSV to use to prepare itself and thus you will probably need to manually specify the desired Encoding for most of those cases.  It will try to guess using the fields in a row of output though, when using ::generate_line or Array#to_csv().I try to point out any other Encoding issues in the documentation of methods as they come up.This has been tested to the best of my ability with all non-“dummy” Encodings Ruby ships with.  However, it is brave new code and may have some bugs. Please feel free to report any issues you find with it.https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/csv/rdoc/CSV.html

Date	A	 	 	Ruby Class	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/date/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 date and datetime class - Tadayoshi Funaba 1998-2011‘date’ provides two classes Date and DateTime.Some terms and definitions are based on ISO 8601 and JIS X 0301.The calendar date is a particular day of a calendar year, identified by its ordinal number within a calendar month within that year.In those classes, this is so-called “civil”.The ordinal date is a particular day of a calendar year identified by its ordinal number within the year.In those classes, this is so-called “ordinal”.The week date is a date identified by calendar week and day numbers.The calendar week is a seven day period within a calendar year, starting on a Monday and identified by its ordinal number within the year; the first calendar week of the year is the one that includes the first Thursday of that year. In the Gregorian calendar, this is equivalent to the week which includes January 4.In those classes, this so-called “commercial”.The Julian day number is in elapsed days since noon (Greenwich mean time) on January 1, 4713 BCE (in the Julian calendar).In this document, the astronomical Julian day number is same as the original Julian day number. And the chronological Julian day number is a variation of the Julian day number. Its days begin at midnight on local time.In this document, when the term “Julian day number” simply appears, it just refers to “chronological Julian day number”, not the original.In those classes, those are so-called “ajd” and “jd”.The modified Julian day number is in elapsed days since midnight (Coordinated universal time) on November 17, 1858 CE (in the Gregorian calendar).In this document, the astronomical modified Julian day number is same as the original modified Julian day number. And the chronological modified Julian day number is a variation of the modified Julian day number. Its days begin at midnight on local time.In this document, when the term “modified Julian day number” simply appears, it just refers to “chronological modified Julian day number”, not the original.In those classes, this is so-called “mjd”.A subclass of Object that includes Comparable module and easily handles date.Date object is created with ::new, ::jd, ::ordinal, ::commercial, ::parse, ::strptime, ::today, Time#to_date or etc.All date objects are immutable; hence cannot modify themselves.The concept of this date object can be represented as a tuple of the day count, the offset and the day of calendar reform.The day count denotes the absolute position of a temporal dimension. The offset is relative adjustment, which determines decoded local time with the day count. The day of calendar reform denotes the start day of the new style. The old style of the West is the Julian calendar which was adopted by Caesar. The new style is the Gregorian calendar, which is the current civil calendar of many countries.The day count is virtually the astronomical Julian day number. The offset in this class is usually zero, and cannot be specified directly.An optional argument the day of calendar reform (start) as a Julian day number, which should be 2298874 to 2426355 or -/+oo. The default value is Date::ITALY (2299161=1582-10-15).  See also sample/cal.rb.Date object has various methods. See each reference.https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/date/rdoc/Date.html
DateTime	A	 	 	Ruby Class	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/date/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 A subclass of Date that easily handles date, hour, minute, second and offset.DateTime does not consider any leap seconds, does not track any summer time rules.DateTime object is created with ::new, ::jd, ::ordinal, ::commercial, ::parse, ::strptime, ::now, Time#to_datetime or etc.The last element of day, hour, minute or second can be fractional number. The fractional number’s precision is assumed at most nanosecond.An optional argument the offset indicates the difference between the local time and UTC. For example, Rational(3,24) represents ahead of 3 hours of UTC, Rational(-5,24) represents behind of 5 hours of UTC. The offset should be -1 to +1, and its precision is assumed at most second. The default value is zero(equals to UTC).also accepts string form.An optional argument the day of calendar reform (start) denotes a Julian day number, which should be 2298874 to 2426355 or -/+oo.  The default value is Date::ITALY (2299161=1582-10-15).DateTime object has various methods. See each reference.It’s a common misconception that William Shakespeare and Miguel de Cervantes died on the same day in history - so much so that UNESCO named April 23 as World Book Day because of this fact. However because England hadn’t yet adopted Gregorian Calendar Reform (and wouldn’t until 1752) their deaths are actually 10 days apart. Since Ruby’s Time class implements a proleptic Gregorian calendar and has no concept of calendar reform then there’s no way to express this. This is where DateTime steps in:Already you can see something’s weird - the days of the week are different, taking this further:This shows that in fact they died 10 days apart (in reality 11 days since Cervantes died a day earlier but was buried on the 23rd). We can see the actual date of Shakespeare’s death by using the gregorian method to convert it:So there’s an argument that all the celebrations that take place on the 23rd April in Stratford-upon-Avon are actually the wrong date since England is now using the Gregorian calendar. You can see why when we transition across the reform date boundary:As you can see, if we’re accurately tracking the number of solar years since Shakespeare’s birthday then the correct anniversary date would be the 4th May and not the 23rd April.So when should you use DateTime in Ruby and when should you use Time? Almost certainly you’ll want to use Time since your app is probably dealing with current dates and times. However, if you need to deal with dates and times in a historical context you’ll want to use DateTime to avoid making the same mistakes as UNESCO. If you also have to deal with timezones then best of luck - just bear in mind that you’ll probably be dealing with local solar times, since it wasn’t until the 19th century that the introduction of the railways necessitated the need for Standard Time and eventually timezones.https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/date/rdoc/DateTime.html

DBM	A	 	 	Ruby Class	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/dbm/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 The DBM class provides a wrapper to a Unix-style dbm or Database Manager library.Dbm databases do not have tables or columns; they are simple key-value data stores, like a Ruby Hash except not resident in RAM. Keys and values must be strings.The exact library used depends on how Ruby was compiled. It could be any of the following:The original ndbm library is released in 4.3BSD. It is based on dbm library in Unix Version 7 but has different API to support multiple databases in a process.Berkeley DB versions 1 thru 5, also known as BDB and Sleepycat DB, now owned by Oracle Corporation.Berkeley DB 1.x, still found in 4.4BSD derivatives (FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc).gdbm, the GNU implementation of dbm.qdbm, another open source reimplementation of dbm.All of these dbm implementations have their own Ruby interfaces available, which provide richer (but varying) APIs.Before you decide to use DBM, there are some issues you should consider:Each implementation of dbm has its own file format. Generally, dbm libraries will not read each other’s files. This makes dbm files a bad choice for data exchange.Even running the same OS and the same dbm implementation, the database file format may depend on the CPU architecture. For example, files may not be portable between PowerPC and 386, or between 32 and 64 bit Linux.Different versions of Berkeley DB use different file formats. A change to the OS may therefore break DBM access to existing files.Data size limits vary between implementations. Original Berkeley DB was limited to 2GB of data. Dbm libraries also sometimes limit the total size of a key/value pair, and the total size of all the keys that hash to the same value. These limits can be as little as 512 bytes. That said, gdbm and recent versions of Berkeley DB do away with these limits.Given the above cautions, DBM is not a good choice for long term storage of important data. It is probably best used as a fast and easy alternative to a Hash for processing large amounts of data.https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/dbm/rdoc/DBM.html

DEBUGGER__	A	 	 	Ruby Class	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/debug/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 This library provides debugging functionality to Ruby.To add a debugger to your code, start by requiring debug in your program:This will cause Ruby to interrupt execution and show a prompt when the say method is run.Once you’re inside the prompt, you can start debugging your program.You can get help at any time by pressing h.The following is a list of common functionalities that the debugger provides.In general, a debugger is used to find bugs in your program, which often means pausing execution and inspecting variables at some point in time.Let’s look at an example:When you run this program, the debugger will kick in just before the foo assignment.In this example, it’d be interesting to move to the next line and inspect the value of foo again. You can do that by pressing n:You now know that the original value of foo was nil, and that it still was nil after calling get_foo.Other useful commands for navigating through your code are:Runs the program until it either exists or encounters another breakpoint. You usually press c when you are finished debugging your program and want to resume its execution.Steps into method definition. In the previous example, s would take you inside the method definition of get_foo.Restart the program.Quit the program.You can use the debugger to easily inspect both local and global variables. We’ve seen how to inspect local variables before:You can also pretty print the result of variables or expressions:You can list all local variables with +v l+:Similarly, you can show all global variables with +v g+:Finally, you can omit p if you simply want to evaluate a variable or expressionRuby Debug provides more advanced functionalities like switching between threads, setting breakpoints and watch expressions, and more. The full list of commands is available at any time by pressing h.Make sure you remove every instance of +require ‘debug’+ before shipping your code. Failing to do so may result in your program hanging unpredictably.Debug is not available in safe mode.https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/debug/rdoc/DEBUGGER__.html

Delegator	A	 	 	Ruby Class	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/delegate/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 This library provides three different ways to delegate method calls to an object.  The easiest to use is SimpleDelegator.  Pass an object to the constructor and all methods supported by the object will be delegated.  This object can be changed later.Going a step further, the top level DelegateClass method allows you to easily setup delegation through class inheritance.  This is considerably more flexible and thus probably the most common use for this library.Finally, if you need full control over the delegation scheme, you can inherit from the abstract class Delegator and customize as needed.  (If you find yourself needing this control, have a look at Forwardable which is also in the standard library.  It may suit your needs better.)SimpleDelegator’s implementation serves as a nice example of the use of Delegator:Be advised, RDoc will not detect delegated methods.https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/delegate/rdoc/Delegator.html

Digest	A	 	 	Ruby Class	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/digest/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 This module provides a framework for message digest libraries.You may want to look at OpenSSL::Digest as it supports more algorithms.A cryptographic hash function is a procedure that takes data and returns a fixed bit string: the hash value, also known as digest. Hash functions are also called one-way functions, it is easy to compute a digest from a message, but it is infeasible to generate a message from a digest.Additionally digests can be encoded in "bubble babble" format as a sequence of consonants and vowels which is more recognizable and comparable than a hexadecimal digest.See the bubble babble specification at web.mit.edu/kenta/www/one/bubblebabble/spec/jrtrjwzi/draft-huima-01.txt.Different digest algorithms (or hash functions) are available:See RFC 1321 The MD5 Message-Digest AlgorithmAs Digest::RMD160. See homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~bosselae/ripemd160.html.See FIPS 180 Secure Hash Standard.See FIPS 180 Secure Hash Standard which defines the following algorithms:SHA512SHA384SHA256The latest versions of the FIPS publications can be found here: csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsFIPS.html.https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/digest/rdoc/Digest.html

DRb	A	 	 	Ruby Class	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/drb/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 dRuby is a distributed object system for Ruby.  It is written in pure Ruby and uses its own protocol.  No add-in services are needed beyond those provided by the Ruby runtime, such as TCP sockets.  It does not rely on or interoperate with other distributed object systems such as CORBA, RMI, or .NET.dRuby allows methods to be called in one Ruby process upon a Ruby object located in another Ruby process, even on another machine. References to objects can be passed between processes.  Method arguments and return values are dumped and loaded in marshalled format.  All of this is done transparently to both the caller of the remote method and the object that it is called upon.An object in a remote process is locally represented by a DRb::DRbObject instance.  This acts as a sort of proxy for the remote object.  Methods called upon this DRbObject instance are forwarded to its remote object.  This is arranged dynamically at run time.  There are no statically declared interfaces for remote objects, such as CORBA’s IDL.dRuby calls made into a process are handled by a DRb::DRbServer instance within that process.  This reconstitutes the method call, invokes it upon the specified local object, and returns the value to the remote caller.  Any object can receive calls over dRuby.  There is no need to implement a special interface, or mixin special functionality.  Nor, in the general case, does an object need to explicitly register itself with a DRbServer in order to receive dRuby calls.One process wishing to make dRuby calls upon another process must somehow obtain an initial reference to an object in the remote process by some means other than as the return value of a remote method call, as there is initially no remote object reference it can invoke a method upon.  This is done by attaching to the server by URI.  Each DRbServer binds itself to a URI such as ‘druby://example.com:8787’.  A DRbServer can have an object attached to it that acts as the server’s front object.  A DRbObject can be explicitly created from the server’s URI.  This DRbObject’s remote object will be the server’s front object.  This front object can then return references to other Ruby objects in the DRbServer’s process.Method calls made over dRuby behave largely the same as normal Ruby method calls made within a process.  Method calls with blocks are supported, as are raising exceptions.  In addition to a method’s standard errors, a dRuby call may also raise one of the dRuby-specific errors, all of which are subclasses of DRb::DRbError.Any type of object can be passed as an argument to a dRuby call or returned as its return value.  By default, such objects are dumped or marshalled at the local end, then loaded or unmarshalled at the remote end.  The remote end therefore receives a copy of the local object, not a distributed reference to it; methods invoked upon this copy are executed entirely in the remote process, not passed on to the local original.  This has semantics similar to pass-by-value.However, if an object cannot be marshalled, a dRuby reference to it is passed or returned instead.  This will turn up at the remote end as a DRbObject instance.  All methods invoked upon this remote proxy are forwarded to the local object, as described in the discussion of DRbObjects.  This has semantics similar to the normal Ruby pass-by-reference.The easiest way to signal that we want an otherwise marshallable object to be passed or returned as a DRbObject reference, rather than marshalled and sent as a copy, is to include the DRb::DRbUndumped mixin module.dRuby supports calling remote methods with blocks.  As blocks (or rather the Proc objects that represent them) are not marshallable, the block executes in the local, not the remote, context.  Each value yielded to the block is passed from the remote object to the local block, then the value returned by each block invocation is passed back to the remote execution context to be collected, before the collected values are finally returned to the local context as the return value of the method invocation.For more dRuby samples, see the samples directory in the full dRuby distribution.This illustrates setting up a simple client-server drb system.  Run the server and client code in different terminals, starting the server code first.This example illustrates returning a reference to an object from a dRuby call.  The Logger instances live in the server process.  References to them are returned to the client process, where methods can be invoked upon them. These methods are executed in the server process.As with all network services, security needs to be considered when using dRuby.  By allowing external access to a Ruby object, you are not only allowing outside clients to call the methods you have defined for that object, but by default to execute arbitrary Ruby code on your server.  Consider the following:The dangers posed by instance_eval and friends are such that a DRbServer should generally be run with $SAFE set to at least level 1.  This will disable eval() and related calls on strings passed across the wire.  The sample usage code given above follows this practice.A DRbServer can be configured with an access control list to selectively allow or deny access from specified IP addresses.  The main druby distribution provides the ACL class for this purpose.  In general, this mechanism should only be used alongside, rather than as a replacement for, a good firewall.dRuby is implemented using three main components: a remote method call marshaller/unmarshaller; a transport protocol; and an ID-to-object mapper.  The latter two can be directly, and the first indirectly, replaced, in order to provide different behaviour and capabilities.Marshalling and unmarshalling of remote method calls is performed by a DRb::DRbMessage instance.  This uses the Marshal module to dump the method call before sending it over the transport layer, then reconstitute it at the other end.  There is normally no need to replace this component, and no direct way is provided to do so. However, it is possible to implement an alternative marshalling scheme as part of an implementation of the transport layer.The transport layer is responsible for opening client and server network connections and forwarding dRuby request across them. Normally, it uses DRb::DRbMessage internally to manage marshalling and unmarshalling.  The transport layer is managed by DRb::DRbProtocol.  Multiple protocols can be installed in DRbProtocol at the one time; selection between them is determined by the scheme of a dRuby URI.  The default transport protocol is selected by the scheme ‘druby:’, and implemented by DRb::DRbTCPSocket.  This uses plain TCP/IP sockets for communication.  An alternative protocol, using UNIX domain sockets, is implemented by DRb::DRbUNIXSocket in the file drb/unix.rb, and selected by the scheme ‘drbunix:’.  A sample implementation over HTTP can be found in the samples accompanying the main dRuby distribution.The ID-to-object mapping component maps dRuby object ids to the objects they refer to, and vice versa.  The implementation to use can be specified as part of a DRb::DRbServer’s configuration.  The default implementation is provided by DRb::DRbIdConv.  It uses an object’s ObjectSpace id as its dRuby id.  This means that the dRuby reference to that object only remains meaningful for the lifetime of the object’s process and the lifetime of the object within that process.  A modified implementation is provided by DRb::TimerIdConv in the file drb/timeridconv.rb.  This implementation retains a local reference to all objects exported over dRuby for a configurable period of time (defaulting to ten minutes), to prevent them being garbage-collected within this time.  Another sample implementation is provided in sample/name.rb in the main dRuby distribution.  This allows objects to specify their own id or “name”. A dRuby reference can be made persistent across processes by having each process register an object using the same dRuby name.frozen_string_literal: falsehttps://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/drb/rdoc/DRb.html

You can distribute/modify this program under the same terms of ruby.Namespace for several file utility methods for copying, moving, removing, etc.The options parameter is a hash of options, taken from the list :force, :noop, :preserve, and :verbose. :noop means that no changes are made.  The other two are obvious. Each method documents the options that it honours.All methods that have the concept of a “source” file or directory can take either one file or a list of files in that argument.  See the method documentation for examples.There are some `low level’ methods, which do not accept any option:This module has all methods of FileUtils module, but it outputs messages before acting.  This equates to passing the :verbose flag to methods in FileUtils.This module has all methods of FileUtils module, but never changes files/directories.  This equates to passing the :noop flag to methods in FileUtils.This module has all methods of FileUtils module, but never changes files/directories.

Forwardable	A	 	 	Ruby Class	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/forwardable/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 The Forwardable module provides delegation of specified methods to a designated object, using the methods def_delegator and def_delegators.For example, say you have a class RecordCollection which contains an array @records.  You could provide the lookup method record_number(), which simply calls [] on the @records array, like this:We can use the lookup method like so:Further, if you wish to provide the methods size, <  You can even extend regular objects with Forwardable.We want to rely on what has come before obviously, but with delegation we can take just the methods we need and even rename them as appropriate.  In many cases this is preferable to inheritance, which gives us the entire old interface, even if much of it isn’t needed.This should output:Be advised, RDoc will not detect delegated methods.forwardable.rb provides single-method delegation via the #def_delegator and #def_delegators methods.

GDBM	A	 	 	Ruby Class	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/gdbm/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 Ruby extension for GNU dbm (gdbm) -- a simple database engine for storing key-value pairs on disk.GNU dbm is a library for simple databases. A database is a file that stores key-value pairs. Gdbm allows the user to store, retrieve, and delete data by key. It furthermore allows a non-sorted traversal of all key-value pairs. A gdbm database thus provides the same functionality as a hash. As with objects of the Hash class, elements can be accessed with []. Furthermore, GDBM mixes in the Enumerable module, thus providing convenient methods such as find, collect, map, etc.A process is allowed to open several different databases at the same time. A process can open a database as a "reader" or a "writer". Whereas a reader has only read-access to the database, a writer has read- and write-access. A database can be accessed either by any number of readers or by exactly one writer at the same time.Opening/creating a database, and filling it with some entries:Reading out a database:produceswww.gnu.org/software/gdbm/https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/gdbm/rdoc/GDBM.html

IRB	A	 	 	Ruby Class	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/irb/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 IRB stands for “interactive Ruby” and is a tool to interactively execute Ruby expressions read from the standard input.The irb command from your shell will start the interpreter.Use of irb is easy if you know Ruby.When executing irb, prompts are displayed as follows. Then, enter the Ruby expression. An input is executed when it is syntactically complete.The Readline extension module can be used with irb. Use of Readline is default if it’s installed.IRB reads from ~/.irbrc when it’s invoked.If ~/.irbrc doesn’t exist, irb will try to read in the following order:.irbrcirb.rc_irbrc$irbrcThe following are alternatives to the command line options. To use them type as follows in an irb session:To enable auto-indent mode in irb, add the following to your .irbrc:To enable autocompletion for irb, add the following to your .irbrc:By default, irb disables history and will not store any commands you used.If you want to enable history, add the following to your .irbrc:This will now store the last 1000 commands in ~/.irb_history.See IRB::Context#save_history= for more information.In order to customize the prompt, you can change the following Hash:This example can be used in your .irbrcOr, invoke irb with the above prompt mode by:Constants PROMPT_I, PROMPT_S and PROMPT_C specify the format. In the prompt specification, some special strings are available:For instance, the default prompt mode is defined as follows:irb comes with a number of available modes:Because irb evaluates input immediately after it is syntactically complete, the results may be slightly different than directly using Ruby.IRB has a special feature, that allows you to manage many sessions at once.You can create new sessions with Irb.irb, and get a list of current sessions with the jobs command in the prompt.JobManager provides commands to handle the current sessions:The exit command, or ::irb_exit, will quit the current session and call any exit hooks with ::irb_at_exit.A few commands for loading files within the session are also available:Loads a given file in the current session and displays the source lines, see IRB::IrbLoader#source_fileLoads the given file similarly to Kernel#load, see IRB::IrbLoader#irb_loadLoads the given file similarly to Kernel#requireThe command line options, or ::conf, specify the default behavior of Irb.irb.On the other hand, each conf in IRB is used to individually configure ::irb.If a proc is set for ::conf, its will be invoked after execution of that proc with the context of the current session as its argument. Each session can be configured using this mechanism.There are a few variables in every Irb session that can come in handy:The value command executed, as a local variableThe history of evaluated commandsReturns the evaluation value at the given line number, line_no. If line_no is a negative, the return value line_no many lines before the most recent return value.frozen_string_literal: falsehttps://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/irb/rdoc/IRB.html

JSONJavaScript Object Notation (JSON)¶ ↑	A	 	 	Ruby Class	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/json/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for us humans to read and write. Plus, equally simple for machines to generate or parse. JSON is completely language agnostic, making it the ideal interchange format.Built on two universally available structures:To read more about JSON visit: json.orgTo parse a JSON string received by another application or generated within your existing application:Notice the extra quotes '' around the hash notation. Ruby expects the argument to be a string and can’t convert objects like a hash or array.Ruby converts your string into a hashCreating a JSON string for communication or serialization is just as simple.Or an alternative way:JSON.generate only allows objects or arrays to be converted to JSON syntax. to_json, however, accepts many Ruby classes even though it acts only as a method for serialization:frozen_string_literal: falsehttps://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/json/rdoc/JSON.html

Logger	A	 	 	Ruby Class	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/logger/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 The Logger class provides a simple but sophisticated logging utility that you can use to output messages.The messages have associated levels, such as INFO or ERROR that indicate their importance.  You can then give the Logger a level, and only messages at that level or higher will be printed.The levels are:An unknown message that should always be logged.An unhandleable error that results in a program crash.A handleable error condition.A warning.Generic (useful) information about system operation.Low-level information for developers.For instance, in a production system, you may have your Logger set to INFO or even WARN. When you are developing the system, however, you probably want to know about the program’s internal state, and would set the Logger to DEBUG.Note: Logger does not escape or sanitize any messages passed to it. Developers should be aware of when potentially malicious data (user-input) is passed to Logger, and manually escape the untrusted data:You can use formatter= for escaping all data.This creates a Logger that outputs to the standard output stream, with a level of WARN:Because the Logger’s level is set to WARN, only the warning, error, and fatal messages are recorded.  The debug and info messages are silently discarded.There are several interesting features that Logger provides, like auto-rolling of log files, setting the format of log messages, and specifying a program name in conjunction with the message.  The next section shows you how to achieve these things.The options below give you various choices, in more or less increasing complexity.Create a logger which logs messages to STDERR/STDOUT.Create a logger for the file which has the specified name.Create a logger for the specified file.Create a logger which ages the logfile once it reaches a certain size. Leave 10 “old” log files where each file is about 1,024,000 bytes.Create a logger which ages the logfile daily/weekly/monthly.Notice the different methods (fatal, error, info) being used to log messages of various levels?  Other methods in this family are warn and debug.  add is used below to log a message of an arbitrary (perhaps dynamic) level.Message in a block.Message as a string.With progname.With severity.The block form allows you to create potentially complex log messages, but to delay their evaluation until and unless the message is logged.  For example, if we have the following:If the logger’s level is INFO or higher, no debug messages will be logged, and the entire block will not even be evaluated.  Compare to this:Here, the string concatenation is done every time, even if the log level is not set to show the debug message.Original interface.Log4r (somewhat) compatible interface.Symbol or String (case insensitive)ConstructorLog messages are rendered in the output stream in a certain format by default.  The default format and a sample are shown below:Log format:Log sample:You may change the date and time format via datetime_format=.or via the constructor.Or, you may change the overall format via the formatter= method.or via the constructor.https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/logger/rdoc/Logger.html

MonitorMixin	A	 	 	Ruby Class	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/monitor/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 In concurrent programming, a monitor is an object or module intended to be used safely by more than one thread.  The defining characteristic of a monitor is that its methods are executed with mutual exclusion.  That is, at each point in time, at most one thread may be executing any of its methods. This mutual exclusion greatly simplifies reasoning about the implementation of monitors compared to reasoning about parallel code that updates a data structure.You can read more about the general principles on the Wikipedia page for MonitorsThe consumer thread waits for the producer thread to push a line to buf while buf.empty?.  The producer thread (main thread) reads a line from ARGF and pushes it into buf then calls empty_cond.signal to notify the consumer thread of new data.SynchronizedArray implements an Array with synchronized access to items. This Class is implemented as subclass of Array which includes the MonitorMixin module.https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/monitor/rdoc/MonitorMixin.html

Net HTTP	A	 	 	Ruby Class	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/net/http/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 Net::HTTP provides a rich library which can be used to build HTTP user-agents.  For more details about HTTP see [RFC2616](www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt)Net::HTTP is designed to work closely with URI.  URI::HTTP#host, URI::HTTP#port and URI::HTTP#request_uri are designed to work with Net::HTTP.If you are only performing a few GET requests you should try OpenURI.All examples assume you have loaded Net::HTTP with:This will also require ‘uri’ so you don’t need to require it separately.The Net::HTTP methods in the following section do not persist connections.  They are not recommended if you are performing many HTTP requests.The following example code can be used as the basis of a HTTP user-agent which can perform a variety of request types using persistent connections.::start immediately creates a connection to an HTTP server which is kept open for the duration of the block.  The connection will remain open for multiple requests in the block if the server indicates it supports persistent connections.The request types Net::HTTP supports are listed below in the section “HTTP Request Classes”.If you wish to re-use a connection across multiple HTTP requests without automatically closing it you can use ::new instead of ::start.  request will automatically open a connection to the server if one is not currently open.  You can manually close the connection with finish.For all the Net::HTTP request objects and shortcut request methods you may supply either a String for the request path or a URI from which Net::HTTP will extract the request path.Each Net::HTTPResponse object belongs to a class for its response code.For example, all 2XX responses are instances of a Net::HTTPSuccess subclass, a 3XX response is an instance of a Net::HTTPRedirection subclass and a 200 response is an instance of the Net::HTTPOK class.  For details of response classes, see the section “HTTP Response Classes” below.Using a case statement you can handle various types of responses properly:A POST can be made using the Net::HTTP::Post request class.  This example creates a urlencoded POST body:At this time Net::HTTP does not support multipart/form-data.  To send multipart/form-data use Net::HTTPGenericRequest#body= and Net::HTTPHeader#content_type=:Other requests that can contain a body such as PUT can be created in the same way using the corresponding request class (Net::HTTP::Put).The following example performs a conditional GET using the If-Modified-Since header.  If the files has not been modified since the time in the header a Not Modified response will be returned.  See RFC 2616 section 9.3 for further details.Basic authentication is performed according to [RFC2617](www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2617.txt)By default Net::HTTP reads an entire response into memory.  If you are handling large files or wish to implement a progress bar you can instead stream the body directly to an IO.HTTPS is enabled for an HTTP connection by #use_ssl=.Or if you simply want to make a GET request, you may pass in an URI object that has a HTTPS URL. Net::HTTP automatically turn on TLS verification if the URI object has a ‘https’ URI scheme.In previous versions of Ruby you would need to require ‘net/https’ to use HTTPS. This is no longer true.Net::HTTP will automatically create a proxy from the http_proxy environment variable if it is present.  To disable use of http_proxy, pass nil for the proxy address.You may also create a custom proxy:See ::new for further details and examples such as proxies that require a username and password.Net::HTTP automatically adds Accept-Encoding for compression of response bodies and automatically decompresses gzip and deflate responses unless a Range header was sent.Compression can be disabled through the Accept-Encoding: identity header.Here is the HTTP request class hierarchy.Net::HTTPRequestNet::HTTP::GetNet::HTTP::HeadNet::HTTP::PostNet::HTTP::PatchNet::HTTP::PutNet::HTTP::ProppatchNet::HTTP::LockNet::HTTP::UnlockNet::HTTP::OptionsNet::HTTP::PropfindNet::HTTP::DeleteNet::HTTP::MoveNet::HTTP::CopyNet::HTTP::MkcolNet::HTTP::TraceHere is HTTP response class hierarchy.

Net	A	 	 	Ruby Class	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/net/imap/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/net/imap/rdoc/Net.html
Net IMAP	A	 	 	Ruby Class	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/net/imap/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 Net::IMAP implements Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) client functionality.  The protocol is described in [IMAP].An IMAP client connects to a server, and then authenticates itself using either authenticate() or login().  Having authenticated itself, there is a range of commands available to it.  Most work with mailboxes, which may be arranged in an hierarchical namespace, and each of which contains zero or more messages.  How this is implemented on the server is implementation-dependent; on a UNIX server, it will frequently be implemented as files in mailbox format within a hierarchy of directories.To work on the messages within a mailbox, the client must first select that mailbox, using either select() or (for read-only access) examine().  Once the client has successfully selected a mailbox, they enter selected state, and that mailbox becomes the current mailbox, on which mail-item related commands implicitly operate.Messages have two sorts of identifiers: message sequence numbers and UIDs.Message sequence numbers number messages within a mailbox from 1 up to the number of items in the mailbox.  If a new message arrives during a session, it receives a sequence number equal to the new size of the mailbox.  If messages are expunged from the mailbox, remaining messages have their sequence numbers “shuffled down” to fill the gaps.UIDs, on the other hand, are permanently guaranteed not to identify another message within the same mailbox, even if the existing message is deleted.  UIDs are required to be assigned in ascending (but not necessarily sequential) order within a mailbox; this means that if a non-IMAP client rearranges the order of mailitems within a mailbox, the UIDs have to be reassigned.  An IMAP client thus cannot rearrange message orders.Net::IMAP supports concurrent threads. For example,This script invokes the FETCH command and the SEARCH command concurrently.An IMAP server can send three different types of responses to indicate failure:the attempted command could not be successfully completed.  For instance, the username/password used for logging in are incorrect; the selected mailbox does not exist; etc.the request from the client does not follow the server’s understanding of the IMAP protocol.  This includes attempting commands from the wrong client state; for instance, attempting to perform a SEARCH command without having SELECTed a current mailbox.  It can also signal an internal server failure (such as a disk crash) has occurred.the server is saying goodbye.  This can be part of a normal logout sequence, and can be used as part of a login sequence to indicate that the server is (for some reason) unwilling to accept your connection.  As a response to any other command, it indicates either that the server is shutting down, or that the server is timing out the client connection due to inactivity.These three error response are represented by the errors Net::IMAP::NoResponseError, Net::IMAP::BadResponseError, and Net::IMAP::ByeResponseError, all of which are subclasses of Net::IMAP::ResponseError.  Essentially, all methods that involve sending a request to the server can generate one of these errors. Only the most pertinent instances have been documented below.Because the IMAP class uses Sockets for communication, its methods are also susceptible to the various errors that can occur when working with sockets.  These are generally represented as Errno errors.  For instance, any method that involves sending a request to the server and/or receiving a response from it could raise an Errno::EPIPE error if the network connection unexpectedly goes down.  See the socket(7), ip(7), tcp(7), socket(2), connect(2), and associated man pages.Finally, a Net::IMAP::DataFormatError is thrown if low-level data is found to be in an incorrect format (for instance, when converting between UTF-8 and UTF-16), and Net::IMAP::ResponseParseError is thrown if a server response is non-parseable.Crispin, “INTERNET MESSAGE ACCESS PROTOCOL - VERSION 4rev1”,RFC 2060, December 1996.

Net POP3	A	 	 	Ruby Class	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/net/pop/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 This library provides functionality for retrieving email via POP3, the Post Office Protocol version 3. For details of POP3, see [RFC1939] (www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1939.txt).This example retrieves messages from the server and deletes them on the server.Messages are written to files named ‘inbox/1’, ‘inbox/2’, .… Replace ‘pop.example.com’ with your POP3 server address, and ‘YourAccount’ and ‘YourPassword’ with the appropriate account details.Call #start and start POP session.Access messages by using #each_mail and/or #mails.Close POP session by calling #finish or use the block form of start.The example above is very verbose. You can shorten the code by using some utility methods. First, the block form of ::start can be used instead of ::new, #start and #finish.#delete_all is an alternative for each_mail and delete.And here is an even shorter example.All the examples above get each message as one big string. This example avoids this.The net/pop library supports APOP authentication. To use APOP, use the Net::APOP class instead of the Net::POP3 class. You can use the utility method, Net::POP3.APOP(). For example:If your POP server provides UIDL functionality, you can grab only selected mails from the POP server. e.g.The Net::POPMail#unique_id method returns the unique-id of the message as a String. Normally the unique-id is a hash of the message.https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/net/pop/rdoc/Net/POP3.html

Net SMTP	A	 	 	Ruby Class	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/net/smtp/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 This library provides functionality to send internet mail via SMTP, the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. For details of SMTP itself, see [RFC2821] (www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2821.txt).This library does NOT provide functions to compose internet mails. You must create them by yourself. If you want better mail support, try RubyMail or TMail or search for alternatives in RubyGems.org or The Ruby Toolbox.FYI: the official documentation on internet mail is: [RFC2822] (www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2822.txt).You must open a connection to an SMTP server before sending messages. The first argument is the address of your SMTP server, and the second argument is the port number. Using ::start with a block is the simplest way to do this. This way, the SMTP connection is closed automatically after the block is executed.Replace ‘your.smtp.server’ with your SMTP server. Normally your system manager or internet provider supplies a server for you.Then you can send messages.You MUST close the SMTP session after sending messages, by calling the finish method:You can also use the block form of ::start/SMTP#start.  This closes the SMTP session automatically:I strongly recommend this scheme.  This form is simpler and more robust.In almost all situations, you must provide a third argument to ::start/SMTP#start. This is the domain name which you are on (the host to send mail from). It is called the “HELO domain”. The SMTP server will judge whether it should send or reject the SMTP session by inspecting the HELO domain.The Net::SMTP class supports three authentication schemes; PLAIN, LOGIN and CRAM MD5.  (SMTP Authentication: [RFC2554]) To use SMTP authentication, pass extra arguments to ::start/SMTP#start.https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/net/smtp/rdoc/Net/SMTP.html

NKF	A	 	 	Ruby Class	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/nkf/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 NKF - Ruby extension for Network Kanji FilterThis is a Ruby Extension version of nkf (Network Kanji Filter). It converts the first argument and returns converted result. Conversion details are specified by flags as the first argument.Nkf is a yet another kanji code converter among networks, hosts and terminals. It converts input kanji code to designated kanji code such as ISO-2022-JP, Shift_JIS, EUC-JP, UTF-8 or UTF-16.One of the most unique faculty of nkf is the guess of the input kanji encodings. It currently recognizes ISO-2022-JP, Shift_JIS, EUC-JP, UTF-8 and UTF-16. So users needn’t set the input kanji code explicitly.By default, X0201 kana is converted into X0208 kana. For X0201 kana, SO/SI, SSO and ESC-(-I methods are supported. For automatic code detection, nkf assumes no X0201 kana in Shift_JIS. To accept X0201 in Shift_JIS, use -X, -x or -S.Output is buffered (DEFAULT), Output is unbuffered.Output code is ISO-2022-JP (7bit JIS), Shift_JIS, EUC-JP, UTF-8N, UTF-16BE, UTF-32BE. Without this option and compile option, ISO-2022-JP is assumed.Input assumption is JIS 7 bit, Shift_JIS, EUC-JP, UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32.Assume  JIS input. It also accepts EUC-JP. This is the default. This flag does not exclude Shift_JIS.Assume Shift_JIS and X0201 kana input. It also accepts JIS. EUC-JP is recognized as X0201 kana. Without -x flag, X0201 kana (halfwidth kana) is converted into X0208.Assume EUC-JP input. It also accepts JIS. Same as -J.No conversion.Output sequence to designate JIS-kanji.

Observable	A	 	 	Ruby Class	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/observer/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 The Observer pattern (also known as publish/subscribe) provides a simple mechanism for one object to inform a set of interested third-party objects when its state changes.The notifying class mixes in the Observable module, which provides the methods for managing the associated observer objects.The observable object must:assert that it has #changedcall #notify_observersAn observer subscribes to updates using #add_observer, which also specifies the method called via notify_observers. The default method for notify_observers is update.The following example demonstrates this nicely.  A Ticker, when run, continually receives the stock Price for its @symbol.  A Warner is a general observer of the price, and two warners are demonstrated, a WarnLow and a WarnHigh, which print a warning if the price is below or above their set limits, respectively.The update callback allows the warners to run without being explicitly called.  The system is set up with the Ticker and several observers, and the observers do their duty without the top-level code having to interfere.Note that the contract between publisher and subscriber (observable and observer) is not declared or enforced.  The Ticker publishes a time and a price, and the warners receive that.  But if you don’t ensure that your contracts are correct, nothing else can warn you.Produces:https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/observer/rdoc/Observable.html

It wraps the OpenSSL library.All examples assume you have loaded OpenSSL with:These examples build atop each other.  For example the key created in the next is used in throughout these examples.This example creates a 2048 bit RSA keypair and writes it to the current directory.Keys saved to disk without encryption are not secure as anyone who gets ahold of the key may use it unless it is encrypted.  In order to securely export a key you may export it with a pass phrase.OpenSSL::Cipher.ciphers returns a list of available ciphers.A key can also be loaded from a file.orOpenSSL will prompt you for your pass phrase when loading an encrypted key. If you will not be able to type in the pass phrase you may provide it when loading the key:RSA provides encryption and decryption using the public and private keys. You can use a variety of padding methods depending upon the intended use of encrypted data.Asymmetric public/private key encryption is slow and victim to attack in cases where it is used without padding or directly to encrypt larger chunks of data. Typical use cases for RSA encryption involve “wrapping” a symmetric key with the public key of the recipient who would “unwrap” that symmetric key again using their private key. The following illustrates a simplified example of such a key transport scheme. It shouldn’t be used in practice, though, standardized protocols should always be preferred.A symmetric key encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted with the corresponding private key of the recipient.By default PKCS#1 padding will be used, but it is also possible to use other forms of padding, see PKey::RSA for further details.Using “private_encrypt” to encrypt some data with the private key is equivalent to applying a digital signature to the data. A verifying party may validate the signature by comparing the result of decrypting the signature with “public_decrypt” to the original data. However, OpenSSL::PKey already has methods “sign” and “verify” that handle digital signatures in a standardized way - “private_encrypt” and “public_decrypt” shouldn’t be used in practice.To sign a document, a cryptographically secure hash of the document is computed first, which is then signed using the private key.To validate the signature, again a hash of the document is computed and the signature is decrypted using the public key. The result is then compared to the hash just computed, if they are equal the signature was valid.If supported by the underlying OpenSSL version used, Password-based Encryption should use the features of PKCS5. If not supported or if required by legacy applications, the older, less secure methods specified in RFC 2898 are also supported (see below).PKCS5 supports PBKDF2 as it was specified in PKCS#5 v2.0. It still uses a password, a salt, and additionally a number of iterations that will slow the key derivation process down. The slower this is, the more work it requires being able to brute-force the resulting key.The strategy is to first instantiate a Cipher for encryption, and then to generate a random IV plus a key derived from the password using PBKDF2. PKCS #5 v2.0 recommends at least 8 bytes for the salt, the number of iterations largely depends on the hardware being used.Use the same steps as before to derive the symmetric AES key, this time setting the Cipher up for decryption.PKCS #5 is a password-based encryption standard documented at RFC2898.  It allows a short password or passphrase to be used to create a secure encryption key. If possible, PBKDF2 as described above should be used if the circumstances allow it.PKCS #5 uses a Cipher, a pass phrase and a salt to generate an encryption key.First set up the cipher for encryptionThen pass the data you want to encrypt throughUse a new Cipher instance set up for decryptionThen pass the data you want to decrypt throughThis example creates a self-signed certificate using an RSA key and a SHA1 signature.You can add extensions to the certificate with OpenSSL::SSL::ExtensionFactory to indicate the purpose of the certificate.The list of supported extensions (and in some cases their possible values) can be derived from the “objects.h” file in the OpenSSL source code.To sign a certificate set the issuer and use OpenSSL::X509::Certificate#sign with a digest algorithm.  This creates a self-signed cert because we’re using the same name and key to sign the certificate as was used to create the certificate.Like a key, a cert can also be loaded from a file.Certificate#verify will return true when a certificate was signed with the given public key.A certificate authority (CA) is a trusted third party that allows you to verify the ownership of unknown certificates.  The CA issues key signatures that indicate it trusts the user of that key.  A user encountering the key can verify the signature by using the CA’s public key.CA keys are valuable, so we encrypt and save it to disk and make sure it is not readable by other users.A CA certificate is created the same way we created a certificate above, but with different extensions.This extension indicates the CA’s key may be used as a CA.This extension indicates the CA’s key may be used to verify signatures on both certificates and certificate revocations.Root CA certificates are self-signed.The CA certificate is saved to disk so it may be distributed to all the users of the keys this CA will sign.The CA signs keys through a Certificate Signing Request (CSR).  The CSR contains the information necessary to identify the key.A CSR is saved to disk and sent to the CA for signing.Upon receiving a CSR the CA will verify it before signing it.  A minimal verification would be to check the CSR’s signature.After verification a certificate is created, marked for various usages, signed with the CA key and returned to the requester.Using our created key and certificate we can create an SSL or TLS connection. An SSLContext is used to set up an SSL session.An SSL server requires the certificate and private key to communicate securely with its clients:Then create an SSLServer with a TCP server socket and the context.  Use the SSLServer like an ordinary TCP server.An SSL client is created with a TCP socket and the context. SSLSocket#connect must be called to initiate the SSL handshake and start encryption.  A key and certificate are not required for the client socket.Note that SSLSocket#close doesn’t close the underlying socket by default. Set SSLSocket#sync_close to true if you want.An unverified SSL connection does not provide much security.  For enhanced security the client or server can verify the certificate of its peer.The client can be modified to verify the server’s certificate against the certificate authority’s certificate:If the server certificate is invalid or context.ca_file is not set when verifying peers an OpenSSL::SSL::SSLError will be raised.https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/openssl/rdoc/OpenSSL.html
OpenSSL ASN1	A	 	 	Ruby Class	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/openssl/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 Abstract Syntax Notation One (or ASN.1) is a notation syntax to describe data structures and is defined in ITU-T X.680. ASN.1 itself does not mandate any encoding or parsing rules, but usually ASN.1 data structures are encoded using the Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) or less often the Basic Encoding Rules (BER) described in ITU-T X.690. DER and BER encodings are binary Tag-Length-Value (TLV) encodings that are quite concise compared to other popular data description formats such as XML, JSON etc. ASN.1 data structures are very common in cryptographic applications, e.g. X.509 public key certificates or certificate revocation lists (CRLs) are all defined in ASN.1 and DER-encoded. ASN.1, DER and BER are the building blocks of applied cryptography. The ASN1 module provides the necessary classes that allow generation of ASN.1 data structures and the methods to encode them using a DER encoding. The decode method allows parsing arbitrary BER-/DER-encoded data to a Ruby object that can then be modified and re-encoded at will.The base class representing ASN.1 structures is ASN1Data. ASN1Data offers attributes to read and set the tag, the tag_class and finally the value of a particular ASN.1 item. Upon parsing, any tagged values (implicit or explicit) will be represented by ASN1Data instances because their "real type" can only be determined using out-of-band information from the ASN.1 type declaration. Since this information is normally known when encoding a type, all sub-classes of ASN1Data offer an additional attribute tagging that allows to encode a value implicitly (:IMPLICIT) or explicitly (:EXPLICIT).Constructive is, as its name implies, the base class for all constructed encodings, i.e. those that consist of several values, opposed to "primitive" encodings with just one single value. Primitive values that are encoded with "infinite length" are typically constructed (their values come in multiple chunks) and are therefore represented by instances of Constructive. The value of an Constructive is always an Array.The most common constructive encodings are SETs and SEQUENCEs, which is why there are two sub-classes of Constructive representing each of them.This is the super class of all primitive values. Primitive itself is not used when parsing ASN.1 data, all values are either instances of a corresponding sub-class of Primitive or they are instances of ASN1Data if the value was tagged implicitly or explicitly. Please cf. Primitive documentation for details on sub-classes and their respective mappings of ASN.1 data types to Ruby objects.When constructing an ASN1Data object the ASN.1 type definition may require certain elements to be either implicitly or explicitly tagged. This can be achieved by setting the tagging attribute manually for sub-classes of ASN1Data. Use the symbol :IMPLICIT for implicit tagging and :EXPLICIT if the element requires explicit tagging.It is possible to create arbitrary ASN1Data objects that also support a PRIVATE or APPLICATION tag class. Possible values for the tag_class attribute are::UNIVERSAL (the default for untagged values):CONTEXT_SPECIFIC (the default for tagged values):APPLICATION:PRIVATEThere is a constant defined for each universal tag:OpenSSL::ASN1::EOC (0)OpenSSL::ASN1::BOOLEAN (1)OpenSSL::ASN1::INTEGER (2)OpenSSL::ASN1::BIT_STRING (3)OpenSSL::ASN1::OCTET_STRING (4)OpenSSL::ASN1::NULL (5)OpenSSL::ASN1::OBJECT (6)OpenSSL::ASN1::ENUMERATED (10)OpenSSL::ASN1::UTF8STRING (12)OpenSSL::ASN1::SEQUENCE (16)OpenSSL::ASN1::SET (17)OpenSSL::ASN1::NUMERICSTRING (18)OpenSSL::ASN1::PRINTABLESTRING (19)OpenSSL::ASN1::T61STRING (20)OpenSSL::ASN1::VIDEOTEXSTRING (21)OpenSSL::ASN1::IA5STRING (22)OpenSSL::ASN1::UTCTIME (23)OpenSSL::ASN1::GENERALIZEDTIME (24)OpenSSL::ASN1::GRAPHICSTRING (25)OpenSSL::ASN1::ISO64STRING (26)OpenSSL::ASN1::GENERALSTRING (27)OpenSSL::ASN1::UNIVERSALSTRING (28)OpenSSL::ASN1::BMPSTRING (30)An Array that stores the name of a given tag number. These names are the same as the name of the tag constant that is additionally defined, e.g. UNIVERSAL_TAG_NAME = "INTEGER" and OpenSSL::ASN1::INTEGER = 2.https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/openssl/rdoc/OpenSSL/ASN1.html
OpenSSL ASN1 ASN1Data	A	 	 	Ruby Class	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/openssl/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 The top-level class representing any ASN.1 object. When parsed by OpenSSL::ASN1.decode, tagged values are always represented by an instance of ASN1Data.When encoding an ASN.1 type it is inherently clear what original type (e.g. INTEGER, OCTET STRING etc.) this value has, regardless of its tagging. But opposed to the time an ASN.1 type is to be encoded, when parsing them it is not possible to deduce the "real type" of tagged values. This is why tagged values are generally parsed into ASN1Data instances, but with a different outcome for implicit and explicit tagging.An implicitly 1-tagged INTEGER value will be parsed as an ASN1Data withtag equal to 1tag_class equal to :CONTEXT_SPECIFICvalue equal to a String that carries the raw encoding of the INTEGER.This implies that a subsequent decoding step is required to completely decode implicitly tagged values.An explicitly 1-tagged INTEGER value will be parsed as an ASN1Data withtag equal to 1tag_class equal to :CONTEXT_SPECIFICvalue equal to an Array with one single element, an instance of OpenSSL::ASN1::Integer, i.e. the inner element is the non-tagged primitive value, and the tagging is represented in the outer ASN1Datahttps://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/openssl/rdoc/OpenSSL/ASN1/ASN1Data.html

Find further details on tagged values there.The only case where Constructive is used directly is for infinite length encodings of primitive values. These encodings are always constructed, with the contents of the value Array being either UNIVERSAL non-infinite length partial encodings of the actual value or again constructive encodings with infinite length (i.e. infinite length primitive encodings may be constructed recursively with another infinite length value within an already infinite length value). Each partial encoding must be of the same UNIVERSAL type as the overall encoding. The value of the overall encoding consists of the concatenation of each partial encoding taken in sequence. The value array of the outer infinite length value must end with a OpenSSL::ASN1::EndOfContent instance.Please note that it is not possible to encode Constructive without the infinite_length attribute being set to true, use OpenSSL::ASN1::Sequence or OpenSSL::ASN1::Set in these cases instead.https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/openssl/rdoc/OpenSSL/ASN1/Constructive.html

OpenSSL Cipher	A	 	 	Ruby Class	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/openssl/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 Provides symmetric algorithms for encryption and decryption. The algorithms that are available depend on the particular version of OpenSSL that is installed.A list of supported algorithms can be obtained byThere are several ways to create a Cipher instance. Generally, a Cipher algorithm is categorized by its name, the key length in bits and the cipher mode to be used. The most generic way to create a Cipher is the followingThat is, a string consisting of the hyphenated concatenation of the individual components name, key length and mode. Either all uppercase or all lowercase strings may be used, for example:For each algorithm supported, there is a class defined under the Cipher class that goes by the name of the cipher, e.g. to obtain an instance of AES, you could also useFinally, due to its wide-spread use, there are also extra classes defined for the different key sizes of AESEncryption and decryption are often very similar operations for symmetric algorithms, this is reflected by not having to choose different classes for either operation, both can be done using the same class. Still, after obtaining a Cipher instance, we need to tell the instance what it is that we intend to do with it, so we need to call eitheroron the Cipher instance. This should be the first call after creating the instance, otherwise configuration that has already been set could get lost in the process.Symmetric encryption requires a key that is the same for the encrypting and for the decrypting party and after initial key establishment should be kept as private information. There are a lot of ways to create insecure keys, the most notable is to simply take a password as the key without processing the password further. A simple and secure way to create a key for a particular Cipher isIf you absolutely need to use passwords as encryption keys, you should use Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2 (PBKDF2) by generating the key with the help of the functionality provided by OpenSSL::PKCS5.pbkdf2_hmac_sha1 or OpenSSL::PKCS5.pbkdf2_hmac.Although there is #pkcs5_keyivgen, its use is deprecated and it should only be used in legacy applications because it does not use the newer PKCS#5 v2 algorithms.The cipher modes CBC, CFB, OFB and CTR all need an "initialization vector", or short, IV. ECB mode is the only mode that does not require an IV, but there is almost no legitimate use case for this mode because of the fact that it does not sufficiently hide plaintext patterns. ThereforeYou should never use ECB mode unless you are absolutely sure that you absolutely need itBecause of this, you will end up with a mode that explicitly requires an IV in any case. Although the IV can be seen as public information, i.e. it may be transmitted in public once generated, it should still stay unpredictable to prevent certain kinds of attacks. Therefore, ideallyAlways create a secure random IV for every encryption of your CipherA new, random IV should be created for every encryption of data. Think of the IV as a nonce (number used once) - it's public but random and unpredictable. A secure random IV can be created as followsAlthough the key is generally a random value, too, it is a bad choice as an IV. There are elaborate ways how an attacker can take advantage of such an IV. As a general rule of thumb, exposing the key directly or indirectly should be avoided at all cost and exceptions only be made with good reason.ECB (which should not be used) and CBC are both block-based modes. This means that unlike for the other streaming-based modes, they operate on fixed-size blocks of data, and therefore they require a "finalization" step to produce or correctly decrypt the last block of data by appropriately handling some form of padding. Therefore it is essential to add the output of #final to your encryption/decryption buffer or you will end up with decryption errors or truncated data.Although this is not really necessary for streaming-mode ciphers, it is still recommended to apply the same pattern of adding the output of #final there as well - it also enables you to switch between modes more easily in the future.If the OpenSSL version used supports it, an Authenticated Encryption mode (such as GCM or CCM) should always be preferred over any unauthenticated mode. Currently, OpenSSL supports AE only in combination with Associated Data (AEAD) where additional associated data is included in the encryption process to compute a tag at the end of the encryption. This tag will also be used in the decryption process and by verifying its validity, the authenticity of a given ciphertext is established.This is superior to unauthenticated modes in that it allows to detect if somebody effectively changed the ciphertext after it had been encrypted. This prevents malicious modifications of the ciphertext that could otherwise be exploited to modify ciphertexts in ways beneficial to potential attackers.An associated data is used where there is additional information, such as headers or some metadata, that must be also authenticated but not necessarily need to be encrypted. If no associated data is needed for encryption and later decryption, the OpenSSL library still requires a value to be set - "" may be used in case none is available.An example using the GCM (Galois/Counter Mode). You have 16 bytes key, 12 bytes (96 bits) nonce and the associated data auth_data. Be sure not to reuse the key and nonce pair. Reusing an nonce ruins the security gurantees of GCM mode.Now you are the receiver. You know the key and have received nonce, auth_data, encrypted and tag through an untrusted network. Note that GCM accepts an arbitrary length tag between 1 and 16 bytes. You may additionally need to check that the received tag has the correct length, or you allow attackers to forge a valid single byte tag for the tampered ciphertext with a probability of 1/256.https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/openssl/rdoc/OpenSSL/Cipher.html

OpenSSL Digest	A	 	 	Ruby Class	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/openssl/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 OpenSSL::Digest allows you to compute message digests (sometimes interchangeably called "hashes") of arbitrary data that are cryptographically secure, i.e. a Digest implements a secure one-way function.One-way functions offer some useful properties. E.g. given two distinct inputs the probability that both yield the same output is highly unlikely. Combined with the fact that every message digest algorithm has a fixed-length output of just a few bytes, digests are often used to create unique identifiers for arbitrary data. A common example is the creation of a unique id for binary documents that are stored in a database.Another useful characteristic of one-way functions (and thus the name) is that given a digest there is no indication about the original data that produced it, i.e. the only way to identify the original input is to "brute-force" through every possible combination of inputs.These characteristics make one-way functions also ideal companions for public key signature algorithms: instead of signing an entire document, first a hash of the document is produced with a considerably faster message digest algorithm and only the few bytes of its output need to be signed using the slower public key algorithm. To validate the integrity of a signed document, it suffices to re-compute the hash and verify that it is equal to that in the signature.Among the supported message digest algorithms are:SHA, SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384 and SHA512MD2, MD4, MDC2 and MD5RIPEMD160DSS, DSS1 (Pseudo algorithms to be used for DSA signatures. DSS is equal to SHA and DSS1 is equal to SHA1)For each of these algorithms, there is a sub-class of Digest that can be instantiated as simply as e.g.The sn (short names) and ln (long names) are defined in <openssl/object.h> and <openssl/obj_mac.h>. They are textual representations of ASN.1 OBJECT IDENTIFIERs. Each supported digest algorithm has an OBJECT IDENTIFIER associated to it and those again have short/long names assigned to them.

First, load the issuer and subject certificates:To create the request we need to create a certificate ID for the subject certificate so the CA knows which certificate we are asking about:Then create a request and add the certificate ID to it:Adding a nonce to the request protects against replay attacks but not all CA process the nonce.To submit the request to the CA for verification we need to extract the OCSP URI from the subject certificate:To submit the request we’ll POST the request to the OCSP URI (per RFC 2560).  Note that we only handle HTTP requests and don’t handle any redirects in this example, so this is insufficient for serious use.First we check if the response has a valid signature.  Without a valid signature we cannot trust it.  If you get a failure here you may be missing a system certificate store or may be missing the intermediate certificates.The response contains the status information (success/fail).  We can display the status as a string:Next we need to know the response details to determine if the response matches our request.  First we check the nonce.  Again, not all CAs support a nonce.  See OpenSSL::OCSP::Request#check_nonce for the meanings of the return values.Then extract the status information for the certificate from the basic response.Then check the validity.

OpenSSL PKCS5	A	 	 	Ruby Class	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/openssl/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 Provides password-based encryption functionality based on PKCS#5. Typically used for securely deriving arbitrary length symmetric keys to be used with an OpenSSL::Cipher from passwords. Another use case is for storing passwords: Due to the ability to tweak the effort of computation by increasing the iteration count, computation can be slowed down artificially in order to render possible attacks infeasible.PKCS5 offers support for PBKDF2 with an OpenSSL::Digest::SHA1-based HMAC, or an arbitrary Digest if the underlying version of OpenSSL already supports it (>= 1.0.0).Typically an arbitrary String that represents the password to be used for deriving a key.Prevents attacks based on dictionaries of common passwords. It is a public value that can be safely stored along with the password (e.g. if PBKDF2 is used for password storage). For maximum security, a fresh, random salt should be generated for each stored password. According to PKCS#5, a salt should be at least 8 bytes long.Allows to tweak the length that the actual computation will take. The larger the iteration count, the longer it will take.Specifies the length in bytes of the output that will be generated. Typically, the key length should be larger than or equal to the output length of the underlying digest function, otherwise an attacker could simply try to brute-force the key. According to PKCS#5, security is limited by the output length of the underlying digest function, i.e. security is not improved if a key length strictly larger than the digest output length is chosen. Therefore, when using PKCS5 for password storage, it suffices to store values equal to the digest output length, nothing is gained by storing larger values.When comparing passwords provided by the user with previously stored values, a common mistake made is comparing the two values using "==". Typically, "==" short-circuits on evaluation, and is therefore vulnerable to timing attacks. The proper way is to use a method that always takes the same amount of time when comparing two values, thus not leaking any information to potential attackers. To compare two values, the following could be used:Please note that the premature return in case of differing lengths typically does not leak valuable information - when using PKCS#5, the length of the values to be compared is of fixed size.https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/openssl/rdoc/OpenSSL/PKCS5.html

OpenSSL PKey	A	 	 	Ruby Class	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/openssl/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 Asymmetric public key algorithms solve the problem of establishing and sharing secret keys to en-/decrypt messages. The key in such an algorithm consists of two parts: a public key that may be distributed to others and a private key that needs to remain secret.Messages encrypted with a public key can only be decrypted by recipients that are in possession of the associated private key. Since public key algorithms are considerably slower than symmetric key algorithms (cf. OpenSSL::Cipher) they are often used to establish a symmetric key shared between two parties that are in possession of each other's public key.Asymmetric algorithms offer a lot of nice features that are used in a lot of different areas. A very common application is the creation and validation of digital signatures. To sign a document, the signatory generally uses a message digest algorithm (cf. OpenSSL::Digest) to compute a digest of the document that is then encrypted (i.e. signed) using the private key. Anyone in possession of the public key may then verify the signature by computing the message digest of the original document on their own, decrypting the signature using the signatory's public key and comparing the result to the message digest they previously computed. The signature is valid if and only if the decrypted signature is equal to this message digest.The PKey module offers support for three popular public/private key algorithms:RSA (OpenSSL::PKey::RSA)DSA (OpenSSL::PKey::DSA)Elliptic Curve Cryptography (OpenSSL::PKey::EC)Each of these implementations is in fact a sub-class of the abstract PKey class which offers the interface for supporting digital signatures in the form of OpenSSL::PKey::PKey#sign and OpenSSL::PKey::PKey#verify.Finally PKey also features OpenSSL::PKey::DH, an implementation of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol based on discrete logarithms in finite fields, the same basis that DSA is built on. The Diffie-Hellman protocol can be used to exchange (symmetric) keys over insecure channels without needing any prior joint knowledge between the participating parties. As the security of DH demands relatively long "public keys" (i.e. the part that is overtly transmitted between participants) DH tends to be quite slow. If security or speed is your primary concern, OpenSSL::PKey::EC offers another implementation of the Diffie-Hellman protocol.https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/openssl/rdoc/OpenSSL/PKey.html

Provides access to a certificate's attributes and allows certificates to be read from a string, but also supports the creation of new certificates from scratch.Certificate is capable of handling DER-encoded certificates and certificates encoded in OpenSSL's PEM format.A certificate may be encoded in DER formator in PEM formatX.509 certificates are associated with a private/public key pair, typically a RSA, DSA or ECC key (see also OpenSSL::PKey::RSA, OpenSSL::PKey::DSA and OpenSSL::PKey::EC), the public key itself is stored within the certificate and can be accessed in form of an OpenSSL::PKey. Certificates are typically used to be able to associate some form of identity with a key pair, for example web servers serving pages over HTTPs use certificates to authenticate themselves to the user.The public key infrastructure (PKI) model relies on trusted certificate authorities ("root CAs") that issue these certificates, so that end users need to base their trust just on a selected few authorities that themselves again vouch for subordinate CAs issuing their certificates to end users.The OpenSSL::X509 module provides the tools to set up an independent PKI, similar to scenarios where the 'openssl' command line tool is used for issuing certificates in a private PKI.First, we need to create a "self-signed" root certificate. To do so, we need to generate a key first. Please note that the choice of "1" as a serial number is considered a security flaw for real certificates. Secure choices are integers in the two-digit byte range and ideally not sequential but secure random numbers, steps omitted here to keep the example concise.The next step is to create the end-entity certificate using the root CA certificate.https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/openssl/rdoc/OpenSSL/X509/Certificate.html

OptParse	A	 	 	Ruby Class	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/optparse/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 OptionParser is a class for command-line option analysis.  It is much more advanced, yet also easier to use, than GetoptLong, and is a more Ruby-oriented solution.The argument specification and the code to handle it are written in the same place.It can output an option summary; you don’t need to maintain this string separately.Optional and mandatory arguments are specified very gracefully.Arguments can be automatically converted to a specified class.Arguments can be restricted to a certain set.All of these features are demonstrated in the examples below.  See make_switch for full documentation.OptionParser can be used to automatically generate help for the commands you write:For options that require an argument, option specification strings may include an option name in all caps. If an option is used without the required argument, an exception will be raised.Used:OptionParser supports the ability to coerce command line arguments into objects for us.OptionParser comes with a few ready-to-use kinds of  type coercion. They are:Date  – Anything accepted by Date.parseDateTime – Anything accepted by DateTime.parseTime – Anything accepted by Time.httpdate or Time.parseURI  – Anything accepted by URI.parseShellwords – Anything accepted by Shellwords.shellwordsString – Any non-empty stringInteger – Any integer. Will convert octal. (e.g. 124, -3, 040)Float – Any float. (e.g. 10, 3.14, -100E+13)Numeric – Any integer, float, or rational (1, 3.4, 1/3)DecimalInteger -- Like Integer, but no octal format.OctalInteger -- Like Integer, but no decimal format.DecimalNumeric -- Decimal integer or float.TrueClass –  Accepts ‘+, yes, true, -, no, false’ and defaults as trueFalseClass – Same as TrueClass, but defaults to falseArray – Strings separated by ‘,’ (e.g. 1,2,3)Regexp – Regular expressions. Also includes options.We can also add our own coercions, which we will cover soon.As an example, the built-in Time conversion is used. The other built-in conversions behave in the same way. OptionParser will attempt to parse the argument as a Time. If it succeeds, that time will be passed to the handler block. Otherwise, an exception will be raised.Used:The accept method on OptionParser may be used to create converters. It specifies which conversion block to call whenever a class is specified. The example below uses it to fetch a User object before the on handler receives it.output:The following example is a complete Ruby program.  You can run it and see the effect of specifying various options.  This is probably the best way to learn the features of optparse.For modern shells (e.g. bash, zsh, etc.), you can use shell completion for command line options.The above examples should be enough to learn how to use this class.

OpenStruct	A	 	 	Ruby Class	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/ostruct/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 An OpenStruct is a data structure, similar to a Hash, that allows the definition of arbitrary attributes with their accompanying values. This is accomplished by using Ruby’s metaprogramming to define methods on the class itself.An OpenStruct employs a Hash internally to store the methods and values and can even be initialized with one:Hash keys with spaces or characters that would normally not be able to use for method calls (e.g. ()[]*) will not be immediately available on the OpenStruct object as a method for retrieval or assignment, but can be still be reached through the Object#send method.Removing the presence of a method requires the execution the #delete_field method as setting the property value to nil will not remove the method.An OpenStruct utilizes Ruby’s method lookup structure to find and define the necessary methods for properties. This is accomplished through the method method_missing and define_method.This should be a consideration if there is a concern about the performance of the objects that are created, as there is much more overhead in the setting of these properties compared to using a Hash or a Struct.https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/ostruct/rdoc/OpenStruct.html
new	A	 	 	Ruby Method	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/ostruct/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 Creates a new OpenStruct object.  By default, the resulting OpenStruct object will have no attributes.https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/ostruct/rdoc/OpenStruct.html#method-c-new

Pathname	A	 	 	Ruby Class	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/pathname/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 Pathname represents the name of a file or directory on the filesystem, but not the file itself.The pathname depends on the Operating System: Unix, Windows, etc. This library works with pathnames of local OS, however non-Unix pathnames are supported experimentally.A Pathname can be relative or absolute.  It’s not until you try to reference the file that it even matters whether the file exists or not.Pathname is immutable.  It has no method for destructive update.The goal of this class is to manipulate file path information in a neater way than standard Ruby provides.  The examples below demonstrate the difference.All functionality from File, FileTest, and some from Dir and FileUtils is included, in an unsurprising way.  It is essentially a facade for all of these, and more.These methods are effectively manipulating a String, because that’s all a path is.  None of these access the file system except for mountpoint?, children, each_child, realdirpath and realpath.+joinparentroot?absolute?relative?relative_path_fromeach_filenamecleanpathrealpathrealdirpathchildreneach_childmountpoint?These methods are a facade for FileTest:blockdev?chardev?directory?executable?executable_real?exist?file?grpowned?owned?pipe?readable?world_readable?readable_real?setgid?setuid?sizesize?socket?sticky?symlink?writable?world_writable?writable_real?zero?These methods are a facade for File:atimebirthtimectimemtimechmod(mode)lchmod(mode)chown(owner, group)lchown(owner, group)fnmatch(pattern, *args)fnmatch?(pattern, *args)ftypemake_link(old)open(*args, &block)readlinkrename(to)statlstatmake_symlink(old)truncate(length)utime(atime, mtime)basename(*args)dirnameextnameexpand_path(*args)splitThese methods are a facade for Dir:::glob::getwd / ::pwdrmdirentrieseach_entry(&block)mkdir(*args)opendir(*args)These methods are a facade for IO:each_line(*args, &block)read(*args)binread(*args)readlines(*args)sysopen(*args)These methods are a mixture of Find, FileUtils, and others:find(&block)mkpathrmtreeunlink / deleteAs the above section shows, most of the methods in Pathname are facades.  The documentation for these methods generally just says, for instance, “See FileTest.writable?”, as you should be familiar with the original method anyway, and its documentation (e.g. through ri) will contain more information.  In some cases, a brief description will follow.https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/pathname/rdoc/Pathname.html

There are few implementations of generator.Uses eratosthenes’ sieve.Uses the trial division method.Generates all positive integers which are not divisible by either 2 or 3. This sequence is very bad as a pseudo-prime sequence. But this is faster and uses much less memory than the other generators.

PStore	A	 	 	Ruby Class	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/pstore/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 PStore implements a file based persistence mechanism based on a Hash.  User code can store hierarchies of Ruby objects (values) into the data store file by name (keys).  An object hierarchy may be just a single object.  User code may later read values back from the data store or even update data, as needed.The transactional behavior ensures that any changes succeed or fail together. This can be used to ensure that the data store is not left in a transitory state, where some values were updated but others were not.Behind the scenes, Ruby objects are stored to the data store file with Marshal.  That carries the usual limitations.  Proc objects cannot be marshalled, for example.By default, file integrity is only ensured as long as the operating system (and the underlying hardware) doesn’t raise any unexpected I/O errors. If an I/O error occurs while PStore is writing to its file, then the file will become corrupted.You can prevent this by setting pstore.ultra_safe = true. However, this results in a minor performance loss, and only works on platforms that support atomic file renames. Please consult the documentation for ultra_safe for details.Needless to say, if you’re storing valuable data with PStore, then you should backup the PStore files from time to time.https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/pstore/rdoc/PStore.html

Psych leverages libyaml [Home page: pyyaml.org/wiki/LibYAML] or [HG repo: bitbucket.org/xi/libyaml] for its YAML parsing and emitting capabilities. In addition to wrapping libyaml, Psych also knows how to serialize and de-serialize most Ruby objects to and from the YAML format.Got more time on your hands?  Keep on reading!Psych provides a range of interfaces for parsing a YAML document ranging from low level to high level, depending on your parsing needs.  At the lowest level, is an event based parser.  Mid level is access to the raw YAML AST, and at the highest level is the ability to unmarshal YAML to Ruby objects.Psych provides a range of interfaces ranging from low to high level for producing YAML documents.  Very similar to the YAML parsing interfaces, Psych provides at the lowest level, an event based system, mid-level is building a YAML AST, and the highest level is converting a Ruby object straight to a YAML document.The high level YAML parser provided by Psych simply takes YAML as input and returns a Ruby data structure.  For information on using the high level parser see ::loadThe high level emitter has the easiest interface.  Psych simply takes a Ruby data structure and converts it to a YAML document.  See ::dump for more information on dumping a Ruby data structure.Currently there is no direct API for dumping Ruby structure to file:Psych provides access to an AST produced from parsing a YAML document.  This tree is built using the Psych::Parser and Psych::TreeBuilder.  The AST can be examined and manipulated freely.  Please see ::parse_stream, Psych::Nodes, and Psych::Nodes::Node for more information on dealing with YAML syntax trees.At the mid level is building an AST.  This AST is exactly the same as the AST used when parsing a YAML document.  Users can build an AST by hand and the AST knows how to emit itself as a YAML document.  See Psych::Nodes, Psych::Nodes::Node, and Psych::TreeBuilder for more information on building a YAML AST.The lowest level parser should be used when the YAML input is already known, and the developer does not want to pay the price of building an AST or automatic detection and conversion to Ruby objects.  See Psych::Parser for more information on using the event based parser.The lowest level emitter is an event based system.  Events are sent to a Psych::Emitter object.  That object knows how to convert the events to a YAML document.  This interface should be used when document format is known in advance or speed is a concern.  See Psych::Emitter for more information.frozen_string_literal: falsefrozen_string_literal: falsefrozen_string_literal: falsefrozen_string_literal: falsefrozen_string_literal: falsefrozen_string_literal: falsefrozen_string_literal: falsefrozen_string_literal: falsefrozen_string_literal: falsefrozen_string_literal: falsefrozen_string_literal: falsefrozen_string_literal: falsefrozen_string_literal: falsefrozen_string_literal: falsefrozen_string_literal: falsefrozen_string_literal: falsefrozen_string_literal: falsefrozen_string_literal: falsefrozen_string_literal: falsefrozen_string_literal: falsehttps://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/psych/rdoc/Psych.html

Psych NodesOverview¶ ↑	A	 	 	Ruby Class	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/psych/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 When using Psych.load to deserialize a YAML document, the document is translated to an intermediary AST.  That intermediary AST is then translated in to a Ruby object graph.In the opposite direction, when using Psych.dump, the Ruby object graph is translated to an intermediary AST which is then converted to a YAML document.Psych::Nodes contains all of the classes that make up the nodes of a YAML AST.  You can manually build an AST and use one of the visitors (see Psych::Visitors) to convert that AST to either a YAML document or to a Ruby object graph.Here is an example of building an AST that represents a list with one scalar:The stream is the root of the tree.  We can then convert the tree to YAML:Or convert it to Ruby:A valid YAML AST must have one Psych::Nodes::Stream at the root.  A Psych::Nodes::Stream node must have 1 or more Psych::Nodes::Document nodes as children.Psych::Nodes::Document nodes must have one and only one child.  That child may be one of:Psych::Nodes::SequencePsych::Nodes::MappingPsych::Nodes::ScalarPsych::Nodes::Sequence and Psych::Nodes::Mapping nodes may have many children, but Psych::Nodes::Mapping nodes should have an even number of children.All of these are valid children for Psych::Nodes::Sequence and Psych::Nodes::Mapping nodes:Psych::Nodes::SequencePsych::Nodes::MappingPsych::Nodes::ScalarPsych::Nodes::AliasPsych::Nodes::Scalar and Psych::Nodes::Alias are both terminal nodes and should not have any children.https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/psych/rdoc/Psych/Nodes.html

Racc	A	 	 	Ruby Class	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/racc/parser/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 Racc is a LALR(1) parser generator. It is written in Ruby itself, and generates Ruby programs.Racc grammar file. Any extension is permitted.A filename for output. default is <filename>.tab.rbPlace logging output in file filename. Default log file name is <filename>.output.output executable file(mode 755). where path is the Ruby interpreter.verbose mode. create filename.output file, like yacc’s y.output file.add debug code to parser class. To display debugging information, use this ‘-g’ option and set @yydebug true in parser class.Output parser which doesn’t need runtime files (racc/parser.rb).Check syntax of racc grammar file and quit.Print messages time to time while compiling.turns off line number converting.Convert line number of actions, inner, header and footer.Call all actions, even if an action is empty.print Racc version and quit.Print copyright and quit.Print usage and quit.To compile Racc grammar file, simply type:This creates Ruby script file “parse.tab.y”. The -o option can change the output filename.If you want your own parser, you have to write a grammar file. A grammar file contains the name of your parser class, grammar for the parser, user code, and anything else. When writing a grammar file, yacc’s knowledge is helpful. If you have not used yacc before, Racc is not too difficult.Here’s an example Racc grammar file.Racc grammar files resemble yacc files. But (of course), this is Ruby code. yacc's $$ is the 'result', $0, $1... is an array called 'val', and $-1, $-2... is an array called '_values'.See the Grammar File Reference for more information on grammar files.Then you must prepare the parse entry method. There are two types of parse methods in Racc, Racc::Parser#do_parse and Racc::Parser#yyparseRacc::Parser#do_parse is simple.It’s yyparse() of yacc, and Racc::Parser#next_token is yylex(). This method must returns an array like [TOKENSYMBOL, ITS_VALUE]. EOF is [false, false]. (TOKENSYMBOL is a Ruby symbol (taken from String#intern) by default. If you want to change this, see the grammar reference.Racc::Parser#yyparse is little complicated, but useful. It does not use Racc::Parser#next_token, instead it gets tokens from any iterator.For example, yyparse(obj, :scan) causes calling +obj#scan+, and you can return tokens by yielding them from +obj#scan+.When debugging, “-v” or/and the “-g” option is helpful.“-v” creates verbose log file (.output). “-g” creates a “Verbose Parser”. Verbose Parser prints the internal status when parsing. But it’s not automatic. You must use -g option and set +@yydebug+ to true in order to get output. -g option only creates the verbose parser.Isn’t there too many “end”? grammar of racc file is changed in v0.10.Racc does not use '%' mark, while yacc uses huge number of '%' marks..Try “racc -v xxxx.y”. It causes producing racc’s internal log file, xxxx.output.Try “racc -g xxxx.y”. This command let racc generate “debugging parser”. Then set @yydebug=true in your parser. It produces a working log of your parser.A parser, which is created by Racc, requires the Racc runtime module; racc/parser.rb.Ruby 1.8.x comes with Racc runtime module, you need NOT distribute Racc runtime files.If you want to include the Racc runtime module with your parser. This can be done by using ‘-E’ option:This command creates myparser.rb which `includes’ Racc runtime. Only you must do is to distribute your parser file (myparser.rb).Note: parser.rb is LGPL, but your parser is not. Your own parser is completely yours.https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/racc/parser/rdoc/Racc.html

RDoc comes with the HTML generator RDoc::Generator::Darkfish and an ri data generator RDoc::Generator::RI.Generators are registered by calling RDoc::RDoc.add_generator with the class of the generator:Before option processing in rdoc, RDoc::Options will call ::setup_options on the generator class with an RDoc::Options instance.  The generator can use RDoc::Options#option_parser to add command-line options to the rdoc tool.  See Custom Options at RDoc::Options for an example and see OptionParser for details on how to add options.You can extend the RDoc::Options instance with additional accessors for your generator.After parsing, RDoc::RDoc will instantiate a generator by calling initialize with an RDoc::Store instance and an RDoc::Options instance.The RDoc::Store instance holds documentation for parsed source code.  In RDoc 3 and earlier the RDoc::TopLevel class held this data.  When upgrading a generator from RDoc 3 and earlier you should only need to replace RDoc::TopLevel with the store instance.RDoc will then call generate on the generator instance.  You can use the various methods on RDoc::Store and in the RDoc::CodeObject tree to create your desired output format.https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/rdoc/rdoc/RDoc/Generator.html

(While the markdown dingus emphasizes in-word underscores, neither the Markdown syntax nor MarkdownTest mention this behavior.)For HTML output, RDoc always auto-links bare URLs.The #break_on_newline extension converts all newlines into hard line breaks as in Github Flavored Markdown. This extension is disabled by default.The css extension enables CSS blocks to be included in the output, but they are not used for any built-in RDoc output format. This extension is disabled by default.Example:The #definition_lists extension allows definition lists using the PHP Markdown Extra syntax, but only one label and definition are supported at this time. This extension is enabled by default.Example:Produces:A small furry mammal that seems to sleep a lotA little insect that is known to enjoy picnicsThe github extension enables a partial set of Github Flavored Markdown. This extension is enabled by default.Supported github extensions include:Use ``` around a block of code instead of indenting it four spaces.Use ``` ruby as the start of a code fence to add syntax highlighting. (Currently only ruby syntax is supported).Enables raw HTML to be included in the output. This extension is enabled by default.Example:The notes extension enables footnote support.

RDoc MarkupSupported Formats¶ ↑RDoc Markup¶ ↑RDoc Markup Reference¶ ↑	A	 	 	Ruby Class	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/rdoc/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 frozen_string_literal: falseRDoc::Markup parses plain text documents and attempts to decompose them into their constituent parts.  Some of these parts are high-level: paragraphs, chunks of verbatim text, list entries and the like.  Other parts happen at the character level: a piece of bold text, a word in code font.  This markup is similar in spirit to that used on WikiWiki webs, where folks create web pages using a simple set of formatting rules.RDoc::Markup and other markup formats do no output formatting, this is handled by the RDoc::Markup::Formatter subclasses.Besides the RDoc::Markup format, the following formats are built in to RDoc:The markdown format as described by daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/. See RDoc::Markdown for details on the parser and supported extensions.The rdtool format.  See RDoc::RD for details on the parser and format.The TomDoc format as described by tomdoc.org/.  See RDoc::TomDoc for details on the parser and supported extensions.You can choose a markup format using the following methods:If you build your documentation with rake use RDoc::Task#markup.If you build your documentation by hand run:and commit .rdoc_options and ship it with your packaged gem.At the top of the file use the :markup: directive to set the default format for the rest of the file.Use the :markup: directive at the top of a comment you want to write in a different format.RDoc::Markup is extensible at runtime: you can add new markup elements to be recognized in the documents that RDoc::Markup parses.RDoc::Markup is intended to be the basis for a family of tools which share the common requirement that simple, plain-text should be rendered in a variety of different output formats and media.  It is envisaged that RDoc::Markup could be the basis for formatting RDoc style comment blocks, Wiki entries, and online FAQs.This code converts input_string to HTML.  The conversion takes place in the convert method, so you can use the same RDoc::Markup converter to convert multiple input strings.You can extend the RDoc::Markup parser to recognize new markup sequences, and to add special processing for text that matches a regular expression.  Here we make WikiWords significant to the parser, and also make the sequences {word} and <no>text…</no> signify strike-through text.  We then subclass the HTML output class to deal with these:Where Encoding support is available, RDoc will automatically convert all documents to the same output encoding.  The output encoding can be set via RDoc::Options#encoding and defaults to Encoding.default_external.The markup engine looks for a document’s natural left margin.  This is used as the initial margin for the document.Consecutive lines starting at this margin are considered to be a paragraph. Empty lines separate paragraphs.Any line that starts to the right of the current margin is treated as verbatim text.  This is useful for code listings:In verbatim text, two or more blank lines are collapsed into one, and trailing blank lines are removed:There were two trailing blank lines right above this paragraph, that have been removed. In addition, the verbatim text has been shifted left, so the amount of indentation of verbatim text is unimportant.For HTML output RDoc makes a small effort to determine if a verbatim section contains Ruby source code.  If so, the verbatim block will be marked up as HTML.  Triggers include “def”, “class”, “module”, “require”, the “hash rocket”# (=>) or a block call with a parameter.A line starting with an equal sign (=) is treated as a heading.  Level one headings have one equals sign, level two headings have two, and so on until level six, which is the maximum (seven hyphens or more result in a level six heading).For example, the above header was obtained with:In HTML output headers have an id matching their name.  The above example’s HTML is:If a heading is inside a method body the id will be prefixed with the method’s id.  If the above header where in the documentation for a method such as:The header’s id would be:The label can be linked-to using SomeClass@Headers.  See Links for further details.A line starting with three or more hyphens (at the current indent) generates a horizontal rule.produces:If a paragraph starts with a “*”, “-”, “<digit>.” or “<letter>.”, then it is taken to be the start of a list.  The margin is increased to be the first non-space following the list start flag.  Subsequent lines should be indented to this new margin until the list ends. For example:produces:this is a list with three paragraphs in the first item.  This is the first paragraph.And this is the second paragraph.This is an indented, numbered list.This is the second item in that listThis is the third conventional paragraph in the first list item.This is the second item in the original listYou can also construct labeled lists, sometimes called description or definition lists.  Do this by putting the label in square brackets and indenting the list body:produces:a small furry mammal that seems to sleep a lota little insect that is known to enjoy picnicsIf you want the list bodies to line up to the left of the labels, use two colons:produces:a small furry mammal that seems to sleep a lota little insect that is known to enjoy picnicsNotice that blank lines right after the label are ignored in labeled lists:produces the same output asIf you want to introduce a verbatim section right after a list, it has to be less indented than the list item bodies, but more indented than the list label, letter, digit or bullet. For instance:produces:point 1point 2, first paragraphpoint 2, second paragraphpoint 2, third paragraphregular paragraph after the listYou can use markup within text (except verbatim) to change the appearance of parts of that text.  Out of the box, RDoc::Markup supports word-based and general markup.Word-based markup uses flag characters around individual words:displays word in a bold fontdisplays word in an emphasized fontdisplays word in a code fontGeneral markup affects text between a start delimiter and an end delimiter. Not surprisingly, these delimiters look like HTML markup.displays text in a bold fontdisplays text in an emphasized font (alternate tag: <i>)displays text in a code font (alternate tag: <code>)Unlike conventional Wiki markup, general markup can cross line boundaries.  You can turn off the interpretation of markup by preceding the first character with a backslash (see Escaping Text Markup, below).Links to starting with http:, https:, mailto:, ftp: or www. are recognized.  An HTTP url that references an external image is converted into an inline image element.Classes and methods will be automatically linked to their definition.  For example, RDoc::Markup will link to this documentation.  By default methods will only be automatically linked if they contain an _ (all methods can be automatically linked through the --hyperlink-all command line option).Single-word methods can be linked by using the # character for instance methods or :: for class methods.  For example, #convert links to convert.  A class or method may be combined like RDoc::Markup#convert.A heading inside the documentation can be linked by following the class or method by an @ then the heading name. RDoc::Markup@Links will link to this section like this: Links at RDoc::Markup.  Spaces in headings with multiple words must be escaped with + like RDoc::Markup@Escaping+Text+Markup. Punctuation and other special characters must be escaped like CGI.escape.The @ can also be used to link to sections.  If a section and a heading share the same name the section is preferred for the link.Links can also be of the form label[url], in which case label is used in the displayed text, and url is used as the target.  If label contains multiple words, put it in braces: {multi word label}[url]. The url may be an http:-type link or a cross-reference to a class, module or method with a label.Links with the rdoc-image: scheme will create an image tag for HTML output.  Only fully-qualified URLs are supported.Links with the rdoc-ref: scheme will link to the referenced class, module, method, file, etc.  If the referenced item is does not exist no link will be generated and rdoc-ref: will be removed from the resulting text.Links starting with rdoc-label:label_name will link to the label_name.  You can create a label for the current link (for bidirectional links) by supplying a name for the current link like rdoc-label:label-other:label-mine.Links starting with link: refer to local files whose path is relative to the --op directory.  Use rdoc-ref: instead of link: to link to files generated by RDoc as the link target may be different across RDoc generators.Example links:Text markup can be escaped with a backslash, as in <tt>, which was obtained with \<tt>.  Except in verbatim sections and between <tt> tags, to produce a backslash you have to double it unless it is followed by a space, tab or newline. Otherwise, the HTML formatter will discard it, as it is used to escape potential links:generates:The \ must be doubled if not followed by white space: \.But not in <tt> tags: in a Regexp, \S matches non-space.This is a link to ruby-langThis is not a link, however: {ruby-lang.org}[www.ruby-lang.org]This will not be linked to RDoc::RDoc#documentInside <tt> tags, more precisely, leading backslashes are removed only if followed by a markup character (<*_+), a backslash, or a known link reference (a known class or method). So in the example above, the backslash of \S would be removed if there was a class or module named S in the current context.This behavior is inherited from RDoc version 1, and has been kept for compatibility with existing RDoc documentation.HTML will convert two/three dashes to an em-dash. Other common characters are converted as well:produces:– or —…‘text’ or `text’“text” or “text”©®Comment blocks can be written fairly naturally, either using # on successive lines of the comment, or by including the comment in a =begin/=end block.  If you use the latter form, the =begin line must be flagged with an rdoc tag:RDoc stops processing comments if it finds a comment line starting with -- right after the # character (otherwise, it will be treated as a rule if it has three dashes or more). This can be used to separate external from internal comments, or to stop a comment being associated with a method, class, or module. Commenting can be turned back on with a line that starts with ++.Names of classes, files, and any method names containing an underscore or preceded by a hash character are automatically linked from comment text to their description. This linking works inside the current class or module, and with ancestor methods (in included modules or in the superclass).Method parameter lists are extracted and displayed with the method description.  If a method calls yield, then the parameters passed to yield will also be displayed:This will get documented as:You can override this using a comment containing ‘:yields: …’ immediately after the method definitionwhich will get documented as:yields: is an example of a documentation directive.  These appear immediately after the start of the document element they are modifying.RDoc automatically cross-references words with underscores or camel-case. To suppress cross-references, prefix the word with a \ character.  To include special characters like "\n", you'll need to use two \ characters in normal text, but only one in <tt> text:produces:“\n” or “\n”Directives are keywords surrounded by “:” characters.This directive prevents documentation for the element from being generated. For classes and modules, methods, aliases, constants, and attributes directly within the affected class or module also will be omitted.  By default, though, modules and classes within that class or module will be documented.  This is turned off by adding the all modifier.In the above code, only class MyModule::Input will be documented.The :nodoc: directive, like :enddoc:, :stopdoc: and :startdoc: presented below, is local to the current file: if you do not want to document a module that appears in several files, specify :nodoc: on each appearance, at least once per file.Stop and start adding new documentation elements to the current container. For example, if a class has a number of constants that you don’t want to document, put a :stopdoc: before the first, and a :startdoc: after the last.  If you don’t specify a :startdoc: by the end of the container, disables documentation for the rest of the current file.Forces a method or attribute to be documented even if it wouldn’t be otherwise.  Useful if, for example, you want to include documentation of a particular private method.Document nothing further at the current level: directives :startdoc: and :doc: that appear after this will not be honored for the current container (file, class or module), in the current file.Only applicable to the initialize instance method.  Normally RDoc assumes that the documentation and parameters for initialize are actually for the new method, and so fakes out a new for the class. The :notnew: directive stops this.  Remember that initialize is private, so you won’t see the documentation unless you use the -a command line option.Overrides the default argument handling with exactly these parameters.Overrides the default yield discovery with these parameters.Lines up to the next blank line or lines with a common prefix in the comment are treated as the method’s calling sequence, overriding the default parsing of method parameters and yield arguments.Multiple lines may be used.Sections allow you to group methods in a class into sensible containers.  If you use the sections ‘Public’, ‘Internal’ and ‘Deprecated’ (the three allowed method statuses from TomDoc) the sections will be displayed in that order placing the most useful methods at the top.  Otherwise, sections will be displayed in alphabetical order.Adds this item to the named section overriding the current section.  Use this to group methods by section in RDoc output while maintaining a sensible ordering (like alphabetical).An empty category will place the item in the default category:Unlike the :section: directive, :category: is not sticky.  The category only applies to the item immediately following the comment.Use the :section: directive to provide introductory text for a section of documentation.Provides section introductory text in RDoc output.  The title following :section: is used as the section name and the remainder of the comment containing the section is used as introductory text.  A section’s comment block must be separated from following comment blocks.  Use an empty title to switch to the default section.The :section: directive is sticky, so subsequent methods, aliases, attributes, and classes will be contained in this section until the section is changed.  The :category: directive will override the :section: directive.A :section: comment block may have one or more lines before the :section: directive.  These will be removed, and any identical lines at the end of the block are also removed.  This allows you to add visual cues to the section.Example:Overrides the default markup type for this comment with the specified markup type.  For Ruby files, if the first comment contains this directive it is applied automatically to all comments in the file.Unless you are converting between markup formats you should use a .rdoc_options file to specify the default documentation format for your entire project.  See Saved Options at RDoc::Options for instructions.At the top of a file the :markup: directive applies to the entire file:For just one comment:See CONTRIBUTING at Markup for instructions on adding a new markup format.Include the contents of the named file at this point. This directive must appear alone on one line, possibly preceded by spaces. In this position, it can be escaped with a \ in front of the first colon.The file will be searched for in the directories listed by the --include option, or in the current directory by default.  The contents of the file will be shifted to have the same indentation as the ‘:’ at the start of the :include: directive.Sets the title for the document.  Equivalent to the --title command line parameter.  (The command line parameter overrides any :title: directive in the source).Equivalent to the --main command line parameter.frozen_string_literal: falsehttps://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/rdoc/rdoc/RDoc/Markup.html

You are responsible for asserting that the output is correct.Example:https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/rdoc/rdoc/RDoc/Markup/FormatterTestCase.html

The easiest way to do this is:Which will automatically create the file and fill it with the options you specified.The following options will not be saved since they interfere with the user’s preferences or with the normal operation of RDoc:--coverage-report--dry-run--encoding--force-update--format--pipe--quiet--template--verboseGenerators can hook into RDoc::Options to add generator-specific command line options.When --format is encountered in ARGV, RDoc calls ::setup_options on the generator class to add extra options to the option parser.  Options for custom generators must occur after --format.  rdoc --help will list options for all installed generators.Example:Of course, RDoc::Options does not respond to spell_dictionary by default so you will need to add it:OptionParser validators will validate and cast user input values.  In addition to the validators that ship with OptionParser (String, Integer, Float, TrueClass, FalseClass, Array, Regexp, Date, Time, URI, etc.), RDoc::Options adds Path, PathArray and Template.https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/rdoc/rdoc/RDoc/Options.html
RDoc Parser	A	 	 	Ruby Class	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/rdoc/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 A parser is simple a class that subclasses RDoc::Parser and implements scan to fill in an RDoc::TopLevel with parsed data.The initialize method takes an RDoc::TopLevel to fill with parsed content, the name of the file to be parsed, the content of the file, an RDoc::Options object and an RDoc::Stats object to inform the user of parsed items.  The scan method is then called to parse the file and must return the RDoc::TopLevel object.  By calling super these items will be set for you.In order to be used by RDoc the parser needs to register the file extensions it can parse.  Use ::parse_files_matching to register extensions.https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/rdoc/rdoc/RDoc/Parser.html
RDoc Parser C	A	 	 	Ruby Class	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/rdoc/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 RDoc::Parser::C attempts to parse C extension files.  It looks for the standard patterns that you find in extensions: rb_define_class, rb_define_method and so on.  It tries to find the corresponding C source for the methods and extract comments, but if we fail we don't worry too much.The comments associated with a Ruby method are extracted from the C comment block associated with the routine that implements that method, that is to say the method whose name is given in the rb_define_method call. For example, you might write:Here RDoc will determine from the rb_define_method line that there’s a method called “flatten” in class Array, and will look for the implementation in the method rb_ary_flatten. It will then use the comment from that method in the HTML output. This method must be in the same source file as the rb_define_method.The comment blocks may include special directives:Documentation for the named class.Documentation for the named module.Documentation for the named rb_define_const.Constant values can be supplied on the first line of the comment like so:The value can contain internal colons so long as they are escaped with a \Documentation for the named rb_define_global_constDocumentation for the named rb_define_variableDocumentation for the named method.  Use this when the method name is unambiguous.Documentation for a singleton method in the given class.  Use this when the method name alone is ambiguous.Documentation for a instance method in the given class.  Use this when the method name alone is ambiguous.Documentation for the named attribute.Because C source doesn’t give descriptive names to Ruby-level parameters, you need to document the calling sequence explicitlyIn addition, RDoc assumes by default that the C method implementing a Ruby function is in the same source file as the rb_define_method call. If this isn’t the case, add the comment:As an example, we might have an extension that defines multiple classes in its Init_xxx method. We could document them usinghttps://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/rdoc/rdoc/RDoc/Parser/C.html

You can override this with a custom argument definition using the :call-seq: directive:The parser extracts yield expressions from method bodies to gather the yielded argument names.  If your method manually calls a block instead of yielding or you want to override the discovered argument names use the :yields: directive:To pick up a metaprogrammed method, the parser looks for a comment starting with ‘##’ before an identifier:The parser looks at the token after the identifier to determine the name, in this example, :meta_method.  If a name cannot be found, a warning is printed and ‘unknown is used.You can force the name of a method using the :method: directive:By default, meta-methods are instance methods.  To indicate that a method is a singleton method instead use the :singleton-method: directive:You can also use the :singleton-method: directive with a name:You can define arguments for metaprogrammed methods via either the :call-seq:, :arg: or :args: directives.Additionally you can mark a method as an attribute by using :attr:, :attr_reader:, :attr_writer: or :attr_accessor:.  Just like for :method:, the name is optional.You can provide documentation for methods that don’t appear using the :method:, :singleton-method: and :attr: directives:Note that by default, the :method: directive will be ignored if there is a standard rdocable item following it.https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/rdoc/rdoc/RDoc/Parser/Ruby.html

A best-effort was made to follow the specification as closely as possible but some choices to deviate were made.A future version of RDoc will warn when a MUST or MUST NOT is violated and may warn when a SHOULD or SHOULD NOT is violated.  RDoc will always try to emit documentation even if given invalid TomDoc.Here are some implementation choices this parser currently makes:This parser allows rdoc-style inline markup but you should not depended on it.This parser allows a space between the comment and the method body.This parser does not require the default value to be described for an optional argument.This parser does not examine the order of sections.  An Examples section may precede the Arguments section.This class is documented in TomDoc format.

REXML Formatters Transitive	A	 	 	Ruby Class	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/rexml/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 The Transitive formatter writes an XML document that parses to an identical document as the source document.  This means that no extra whitespace nodes are inserted, and whitespace within text nodes is preserved.  Within these constraints, the document is pretty-printed, with whitespace inserted into the metadata to introduce formatting.Note that this is only useful if the original XML is not already formatted. Since this formatter does not alter whitespace nodes, the results of formatting already formatted XML will be odd.https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/rexml/rdoc/REXML/Formatters/Transitive.html
REXML Functions	A	 	 	Ruby Class	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/rexml/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 If you add a method, keep in mind two things: (1) the first argument will always be a list of nodes from which to filter.  In the case of context methods (such as position), the function should return an array with a value for each child in the array. (2) all method calls from XML will have “-” replaced with “_”. Therefore, in XML, “local-name()” is identical (and actually becomes) “local_name()”https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/rexml/rdoc/REXML/Functions.html

Ripper	A	 	 	Ruby Class	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/ripper/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 Ripper is a Ruby script parser.You can get information from the parser with event-based style. Information such as abstract syntax trees or simple lexical analysis of the Ruby program.Ripper provides an easy interface for parsing your program into a symbolic expression tree (or S-expression).Understanding the output of the parser may come as a challenge, it’s recommended you use PP to format the output for legibility.You can see in the example above, the expression starts with :program.From here, a method definition at :def, followed by the method’s identifier :@ident. After the method’s identifier comes the parentheses :paren and the method parameters under :params.Next is the method body, starting at :bodystmt (stmt meaning statement), which contains the full definition of the method.In our case, we’re simply returning a String, so next we have the :string_literal expression.Within our :string_literal you’ll notice two @tstring_content, this is the literal part for Hello,  and !. Between the two @tstring_content statements is a :string_embexpr, where embexpr is an embedded expression. Our expression consists of a local variable, or var_ref, with the identifier (@ident) of world.Ruby Insideruby 1.9 (support CVS HEAD only)bison 1.28 or later (Other yaccs do not work)https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/ripper/rdoc/Ripper.html

This portion of the standard library provides tooling to read and create these feeds.The standard library supports RSS 0.91, 1.0, 2.0, and Atom, a related format. Here are some links to the standards documents for these formats:RSS0.9.11.02.0AtomIf you’d like to read someone’s RSS feed with your Ruby code, you’ve come to the right place. It’s really easy to do this, but we’ll need the help of open-uri:As you can see, the workhorse is RSS::Parser#parse, which takes the source of the feed and a parameter that performs validation on the feed. We get back an object that has all of the data from our feed, accessible through methods. This example shows getting the title out of the channel element, and looping through the list of items.Producing our own RSS feeds is easy as well. Let’s make a very basic feed:As you can see, this is a very Builder-like DSL. This code will spit out an Atom feed with one item. If we needed a second item, we’d make another block with maker.items.new_item and build a second one.Copyright © 2003-2007 Kouhei Sutou <kou@cozmixng.org>You can redistribute it and/or modify it under the same terms as Ruby.There is an additional tutorial by the author of RSS at: www.cozmixng.org/~rwiki/?cmd=view;name=RSS+Parser%3A%3ATutorial.enfrozen_string_literal: falsehttps://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/rss/rdoc/RSS.html

Gem	A	 	 	Ruby Class	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/rubygems/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 RubyGems is the Ruby standard for publishing and managing third party libraries.For user documentation, see:gem help and gem help [command]RubyGems User GuideFrequently Asked QuestionsFor gem developer documentation see:Creating GemsGem::SpecificationGem::Version for version dependency notesFurther RubyGems documentation can be found at:RubyGems GuidesRubyGems API (also available from gem server)As of RubyGems 1.3.2, RubyGems will load plugins installed in gems or $LOAD_PATH.  Plugins must be named ‘rubygems_plugin’ (.rb, .so, etc) and placed at the root of your gem’s require_path.  Plugins are discovered via ::find_files then loaded.  Take care when implementing a plugin as your plugin file may be loaded multiple times if multiple versions of your gem are installed.For an example plugin, see the graph gem which adds a `gem graph` command.RubyGems defaults are stored in rubygems/defaults.rb.  If you’re packaging RubyGems or implementing Ruby you can change RubyGems’ defaults.For RubyGems packagers, provide lib/rubygems/defaults/operating_system.rb and override any defaults from lib/rubygems/defaults.rb.For Ruby implementers, provide lib/rubygems/defaults/#{RUBY_ENGINE}.rb and override any defaults from lib/rubygems/defaults.rb.If you need RubyGems to perform extra work on install or uninstall, your defaults override file can set pre and post install and uninstall hooks. See ::pre_install, ::pre_uninstall, ::post_install, ::post_uninstall.You can submit bugs to the RubyGems bug tracker on GitHubRubyGems is currently maintained by Eric Hodel.RubyGems was originally developed at RubyConf 2003 by:Rich Kilmer  – rich(at)infoether.comChad Fowler  – chad(at)chadfowler.comDavid Black  – dblack(at)wobblini.netPaul Brannan – paul(at)atdesk.comJim Weirich   – jim(at)weirichhouse.orgContributors:Gavin Sinclair     – gsinclair(at)soyabean.com.auGeorge Marrows     – george.marrows(at)ntlworld.comDick Davies        – rasputnik(at)hellooperator.netMauricio Fernandez – batsman.geo(at)yahoo.comSimon Strandgaard  – neoneye(at)adslhome.dkDave Glasser       – glasser(at)mit.eduPaul Duncan        – pabs(at)pablotron.orgVille Aine         – vaine(at)cs.helsinki.fiEric Hodel         – drbrain(at)segment7.netDaniel Berger      – djberg96(at)gmail.comPhil Hagelberg     – technomancy(at)gmail.comRyan Davis         – ryand-ruby(at)zenspider.comEvan Phoenix       – evan(at)fallingsnow.netSteve Klabnik      – steve(at)steveklabnik.com(If your name is missing, PLEASE let us know!)See LICENSE.txt for permissions.Thanks!-The RubyGems Teamfrozen_string_literal: truefrozen_string_literal: truefrozen_string_literal: truefrozen_string_literal: truehttps://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/rubygems/rdoc/Gem.html

Gem SecuritySigning gems¶ ↑	A	 	 	Ruby Class	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/rubygems/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 The Gem::Security implements cryptographic signatures for gems.  The section below is a step-by-step guide to using signed gems and generating your own.In order to start signing your gems, you’ll need to build a private key and a self-signed certificate.  Here’s how:This could take anywhere from a few seconds to a minute or two, depending on the speed of your computer (public key algorithms aren’t exactly the speediest crypto algorithms in the world).  When it’s finished, you’ll see the files “gem-private_key.pem” and “gem-public_cert.pem” in the current directory.First things first: Move both files to ~/.gem if you don’t already have a key and certificate in that directory.  Ensure the file permissions make the key unreadable by others (by default the file is saved securely).Keep your private key hidden; if it’s compromised, someone can sign packages as you (note: PKI has ways of mitigating the risk of stolen keys; more on that later).In RubyGems 2 and newer there is no extra work to sign a gem.  RubyGems will automatically find your key and certificate in your home directory and use them to sign newly packaged gems.If your certificate is not self-signed (signed by a third party) RubyGems will attempt to load the certificate chain from the trusted certificates. Use gem cert --add signing_cert.pem to add your signers as trusted certificates.  See below for further information on certificate chains.If you build your gem it will automatically be signed.  If you peek inside your gem file, you’ll see a couple of new files have been added:If you wish to store your key in a separate secure location you’ll need to set your gems up for signing by hand.  To do this, set the signing_key and cert_chain in the gemspec before packaging your gem:When you package your gem with these options set RubyGems will automatically load your key and certificate from the secure paths.Now let’s verify the signature.  Go ahead and install the gem, but add the following options: -P HighSecurity, like this:The -P option sets your security policy – we’ll talk about that in just a minute.  Eh, what’s this?The culprit here is the security policy.  RubyGems has several different security policies.  Let’s take a short break and go over the security policies.  Here’s a list of the available security policies, and a brief description of each one:NoSecurity - Well, no security at all.  Signed packages are treated like unsigned packages.LowSecurity - Pretty much no security.  If a package is signed then RubyGems will make sure the signature matches the signing certificate, and that the signing certificate hasn't expired, but that's it.  A malicious user could easily circumvent this kind of security.MediumSecurity - Better than LowSecurity and NoSecurity, but still fallible.  Package contents are verified against the signing certificate, and the signing certificate is checked for validity, and checked against the rest of the certificate chain (if you don't know what a certificate chain is, stay tuned, we'll get to that). The biggest improvement over LowSecurity is that MediumSecurity won't install packages that are signed by untrusted sources. Unfortunately, MediumSecurity still isn't totally secure -- a malicious user can still unpack the gem, strip the signatures, and distribute the gem unsigned.HighSecurity - Here's the bugger that got us into this mess. The HighSecurity policy is identical to the MediumSecurity policy, except that it does not allow unsigned gems.  A malicious user doesn't have a whole lot of options here; they can't modify the package contents without invalidating the signature, and they can't modify or remove signature or the signing certificate chain, or RubyGems will simply refuse to install the package.  Oh well, maybe they'll have better luck causing problems for CPAN users instead :).The reason RubyGems refused to install your shiny new signed gem was because it was from an untrusted source.  Well, your code is infallible (naturally), so you need to add yourself as a trusted source:You’ve now added your public certificate as a trusted source.  Now you can install packages signed by your private key without any hassle.  Let’s try the install command above again:This time RubyGems will accept your signed package and begin installing.While you’re waiting for RubyGems to work it’s magic, have a look at some of the other security commands by running gem help cert:We’ve already covered the --build option, and the --add, --list, and --remove commands seem fairly straightforward; they allow you to add, list, and remove the certificates in your trusted certificate list.  But what’s with this --sign option?To answer that question, let’s take a look at “certificate chains”, a concept I mentioned earlier.  There are a couple of problems with self-signed certificates: first of all, self-signed certificates don’t offer a whole lot of security.  Sure, the certificate says Yukihiro Matsumoto, but how do I know it was actually generated and signed by matz himself unless he gave me the certificate in person?The second problem is scalability.  Sure, if there are 50 gem authors, then I have 50 trusted certificates, no problem.  What if there are 500 gem authors?  1000?  Having to constantly add new trusted certificates is a pain, and it actually makes the trust system less secure by encouraging RubyGems users to blindly trust new certificates.Here’s where certificate chains come in.  A certificate chain establishes an arbitrarily long chain of trust between an issuing certificate and a child certificate.  So instead of trusting certificates on a per-developer basis, we use the PKI concept of certificate chains to build a logical hierarchy of trust.  Here’s a hypothetical example of a trust hierarchy based (roughly) on geography:Now, rather than having 4 trusted certificates (one for drbrain, zenspider, pabs@dc, and tomecope@dc), a user could actually get by with one certificate, the “rubygems@rubygems.org” certificate.Here’s how it works:I install “rdoc-3.12.gem”, a package signed by “drbrain”.  I’ve never heard of “drbrain”, but his certificate has a valid signature from the “seattle.rb@seattlerb.org” certificate, which in turn has a valid signature from the “rubygems@rubygems.org” certificate.  Voila!  At this point, it’s much more reasonable for me to trust a package signed by “drbrain”, because I can establish a chain to “rubygems@rubygems.org”, which I do trust.The --sign option allows all this to happen.  A developer creates their build certificate with the --build option, then has their certificate signed by taking it with them to their next regional Ruby meetup (in our hypothetical example), and it’s signed there by the person holding the regional RubyGems signing certificate, which is signed at the next RubyConf by the holder of the top-level RubyGems certificate.  At each point the issuer runs the same command:Then the holder of issued certificate (in this case, your buddy “drbrain”), can start using this signed certificate to sign RubyGems.  By the way, in order to let everyone else know about his new fancy signed certificate, “drbrain” would save his newly signed certificate as ~/.gem/gem-public_cert.pemObviously this RubyGems trust infrastructure doesn’t exist yet.  Also, in the “real world”, issuers actually generate the child certificate from a certificate request, rather than sign an existing certificate.  And our hypothetical infrastructure is missing a certificate revocation system. These are that can be fixed in the future…At this point you should know how to do all of these new and interesting things:build a gem signing key and certificateadjust your security policymodify your trusted certificate listsign a certificateIn case you don’t trust RubyGems you can verify gem signatures manually:Fetch and unpack the gemGrab the public key from the gemspecGenerate a SHA1 hash of the data.tar.gzVerify the signatureCompare your hash to the verified hashRepeat 5 and 6 with metadata.gzThe .pem files generated by –build and –sign are PEM files.  Here’s a couple of useful OpenSSL commands for manipulating them:And you can do the same thing with the private key file as well:There’s no way to define a system-wide trust list.custom security policies (from a YAML file, etc)Simple method to generate a signed certificate requestSupport for OCSP, SCVP, CRLs, or some other form of cert status check (list is in order of preference)Support for encrypted private keysSome sort of semi-formal trust hierarchy (see long-winded explanation above)Path discovery (for gem certificate chains that don’t have a self-signed root) – by the way, since we don’t have this, THE ROOT OF THE CERTIFICATE CHAIN MUST BE SELF SIGNED if Gem::Security::Policy#verify_root is true (and it is for the MediumSecurity and HighSecurity policies)Better explanation of X509 naming (ie, we don’t have to use email addresses)Honor AIA field (see note about OCSP above)Honor extension restrictionsMight be better to store the certificate chain as a PKCS#7 or PKCS#12 file, instead of an array embedded in the metadata.Flexible signature and key algorithms, not hard-coded to RSA and SHA1.Paul Duncan <pabs@pablotron.org> pablotron.org/frozen_string_literal: truehttps://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/rubygems/rdoc/Gem/Security.html

Gem Version	A	 	 	Ruby Class	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/rubygems/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 frozen_string_literal: trueThe Version class processes string versions into comparable values. A version string should normally be a series of numbers separated by periods. Each part (digits separated by periods) is considered its own number, and these are used for sorting. So for instance, 3.10 sorts higher than 3.2 because ten is greater than two.If any part contains letters (currently only a-z are supported) then that version is considered prerelease. Versions with a prerelease part in the Nth part sort less than versions with N-1 parts. Prerelease parts are sorted alphabetically using the normal Ruby string sorting rules. If a prerelease part contains both letters and numbers, it will be broken into multiple parts to provide expected sort behavior (1.0.a10 becomes 1.0.a.10, and is greater than 1.0.a9).Prereleases sort between real releases (newest to oldest):1.01.0.b11.0.a.20.9If you want to specify a version restriction that includes both prereleases and regular releases of the 1.x series this is the best way:Users expect to be able to specify a version constraint that gives them some reasonable expectation that new versions of a library will work with their software if the version constraint is true, and not work with their software if the version constraint is false.  In other words, the perfect system will accept all compatible versions of the library and reject all incompatible versions.Libraries change in 3 ways (well, more than 3, but stay focused here!).The change may be an implementation detail only and have no effect on the client software.The change may add new features, but do so in a way that client software written to an earlier version is still compatible.The change may change the public interface of the library in such a way that old software is no longer compatible.Some examples are appropriate at this point.  Suppose I have a Stack class that supports a push and a pop method.Switch from an array based implementation to a linked-list based implementation.Provide an automatic (and transparent) backing store for large stacks.Add a depth method to return the current depth of the stack.Add a top method that returns the current top of stack (without changing the stack).Change push so that it returns the item pushed (previously it had no usable return value).Changes pop so that it no longer returns a value (you must use top to get the top of the stack).Rename the methods to push_item and pop_item.Versions shall be represented by three non-negative integers, separated by periods (e.g. 3.1.4).  The first integers is the “major” version number, the second integer is the “minor” version number, and the third integer is the “build” number.A category 1 change (implementation detail) will increment the build number.A category 2 change (backwards compatible) will increment the minor version number and reset the build number.A category 3 change (incompatible) will increment the major build number and reset the minor and build numbers.Any “public” release of a gem should have a different version.  Normally that means incrementing the build number.  This means a developer can generate builds all day long, but as soon as they make a public release, the version must be updated.Let’s work through a project lifecycle using our Stack example from above.The initial Stack class is release.Switched to a linked=list implementation because it is cooler.Added a depth method.Added top and made pop return nil (pop used to return the  old top item).push now returns the value pushed (it used it return nil).Fixed a bug in the linked list implementation.Fixed a bug introduced in the last fix.Client A needs a stack with basic push/pop capability.  They write to the original interface (no top), so their version constraint looks like:Essentially, any version is OK with Client A.  An incompatible change to the library will cause them grief, but they are willing to take the chance (we call Client A optimistic).Client B is just like Client A except for two things: (1) They use the depth method and (2) they are worried about future incompatibilities, so they write their version constraint like this:The depth method was introduced in version 0.1.0, so that version or anything later is fine, as long as the version stays below version 1.0 where incompatibilities are introduced.  We call Client B pessimistic because they are worried about incompatible future changes (it is OK to be pessimistic!).From: blog.zenspider.com/2008/10/rubygems-howto-preventing-cata.htmlLet’s say you’re depending on the fnord gem version 2.y.z. If you specify your dependency as “>= 2.0.0” then, you’re good, right? What happens if fnord 3.0 comes out and it isn’t backwards compatible with 2.y.z? Your stuff will break as a result of using “>=”. The better route is to specify your dependency with an “approximate” version specifier (“~>”). They’re a tad confusing, so here is how the dependency specifiers work:For the last example, single-digit versions are automatically extended with a zero to give a sensible result.https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/rubygems/rdoc/Gem/Version.html

Scanf	A	 	 	Ruby Class	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/scanf/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 frozen_string_literal: false scanf for Rubyscanf is an implementation of the C function scanf(3), modified as necessary for Ruby compatibility.the methods provided are String#scanf, IO#scanf, and Kernel#scanf. Kernel#scanf is a wrapper around STDIN.scanf.  IO#scanf can be used on any IO stream, including file handles and sockets. scanf can be called either with or without a block.Scanf scans an input string or stream according to a format, as described below in Conversions, and returns an array of matches between the format and the input.  The format is defined in a string, and is similar (though not identical) to the formats used in Kernel#printf and Kernel#sprintf.The format may contain conversion specifiers, which tell scanf what form (type) each particular matched substring should be converted to (e.g., decimal integer, floating point number, literal string, etc.)  The matches and conversions take place from left to right, and the conversions themselves are returned as an array.The format string may also contain characters other than those in the conversion specifiers.  White space (blanks, tabs, or newlines) in the format string matches any amount of white space, including none, in the input.  Everything else matches only itself.Scanning stops, and scanf returns, when any input character fails to match the specifications in the format string, or when input is exhausted, or when everything in the format string has been matched. All matches found up to the stopping point are returned in the return array (or yielded to the block, if a block was given).When called with a block, scanf keeps scanning the input, cycling back to the beginning of the format string, and yields a new array of conversions to the block every time the format string is matched (including partial matches, but not including complete failures).  The actual return value of scanf when called with a block is an array containing the results of all the executions of the block.The single argument to scanf is a format string, which generally includes one or more conversion specifiers.  Conversion specifiers begin with the percent character (‘%’) and include information about what scanf should next scan for (string, decimal number, single character, etc.).There may be an optional maximum field width, expressed as a decimal integer, between the % and the conversion.  If no width is given, a default of `infinity’ is used (with the exception of the %c specifier; see below).  Otherwise, given a field width of n for a given conversion, at most n characters are scanned in processing that conversion.  Before conversion begins, most conversions skip white space in the input string; this white space is not counted against the field width.The following conversions are available.Matches a literal `%‘. That is, `%%’ in the format string matches a single input `%‘ character. No conversion is done, and the resulting ’%‘ is not included in the return array.Matches an optionally signed decimal integer.Same as d.Matches an optionally signed integer. The integer is read in base 16 if it begins with `0x’ or `0X’, in base 8 if it begins with `0’, and in base 10 other- wise. Only characters that correspond to the base are recognized.Matches an optionally signed octal integer.Matches an optionally signed hexadecimal integer,Matches an optionally signed floating-point number.Matches a sequence of non-white-space character. The input string stops at white space or at the maximum field width, whichever occurs first.Matches a single character, or a sequence of n characters if a field width of n is specified. The usual skip of leading white space is suppressed. To skip white space first, use an explicit space in the format.Matches a nonempty sequence of characters from the specified set of accepted characters.  The usual skip of leading white space is suppressed.  This bracketed sub-expression is interpreted exactly like a character class in a Ruby regular expression.  (In fact, it is placed as-is in a regular expression.)  The matching against the input string ends with the appearance of a character not in (or, with a circumflex, in) the set, or when the field width runs out, whichever comes first.To require that a particular match occur, but without including the result in the return array, place the assignment suppression flag, which is the star character (‘*’), immediately after the leading ‘%’ of a format specifier (just before the field width, if any).scanf for Ruby is based on the C function scanf(3), but with modifications, dictated mainly by the underlying differences between the languages.The only flag implemented in scanf for Ruby is ‘*’ (ignore upcoming conversion).  Many of the flags available in C versions of scanf(3) have to do with the type of upcoming pointer arguments, and are meaningless in Ruby.The n specifier (store number of characters consumed so far in next pointer) is not implemented.The p specifier (match a pointer value) is not implemented.In scanf for Ruby, all of these specifiers scan for an optionally signed integer, rather than for an unsigned integer like their C counterparts.scanf for Ruby returns an array of successful conversions, whereas scanf(3) returns the number of conversions successfully completed. (See below for more details on scanf for Ruby’s return values.)Without a block, scanf returns an array containing all the conversions it has found.  If none are found, scanf will return an empty array. An unsuccessful match is never ignored, but rather always signals the end of the scanning operation.  If the first unsuccessful match takes place after one or more successful matches have already taken place, the returned array will contain the results of those successful matches.With a block scanf returns a ‘map’-like array of transformations from the block – that is, an array reflecting what the block did with each yielded result from the iterative scanf operation.  (See “Block usage”, above.)When using IO#scanf under Windows, make sure you open your files in binary mode:so that scanf can keep track of characters correctly.Support for character classes is reasonably complete (since it essentially piggy-backs on Ruby’s regular expression handling of character classes), but users are advised that character class testing has not been exhaustive, and that they should exercise some caution in using any of the more complex and/or arcane character class idioms.© 2002-2003 David Alan BlackDistributed on the same licensing terms as Ruby itselfThis software is provided “as is” and without any express or implied warranties, including, without limitation, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.scanf was developed as the major activity of the Austin Ruby Codefest (Austin, Texas, August 2002).David Alan Black (dblack@superlink.net)Hal Fulton (hal9000@hypermetrics.com)Nolan Darilek, Jason JohnstonThanks to Hal Fulton for hosting the Codefest.Thanks to Matz for suggestions about the class design.Thanks to Gavin Sinclair for some feedback on the documentation.The text for parts of this document, especially the Description and Conversions sections, above, were adapted from the Linux Programmer’s Manual manpage for scanf(3), dated 1995-11-01.scanf for Ruby is based on something of an amalgam of C scanf implementations and documentation, rather than on a single canonical description.

Set	A	 	 	Ruby Class	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/set/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 Set implements a collection of unordered values with no duplicates. This is a hybrid of Array's intuitive inter-operation facilities and Hash's fast lookup.Set is easy to use with Enumerable objects (implementing each). Most of the initializer methods and binary operators accept generic Enumerable objects besides sets and arrays.  An Enumerable object can be converted to Set using the to_set method.Set uses Hash as storage, so you must note the following points:Equality of elements is determined according to Object#eql? and Object#hash.  Use #compare_by_identity to make a set compare its elements by their identity.Set assumes that the identity of each element does not change while it is stored.  Modifying an element of a set will render the set to an unreliable state.When a string is to be stored, a frozen copy of the string is stored instead unless the original string is already frozen.The comparison operators <, >, <= and >= are implemented as shorthand for the {proper_,}{subset?,superset?} methods.  However, the <=> operator is intentionally left out because not every pair of sets is comparable. ({x,y} vs. {x,z} for example)https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/set/rdoc/Set.html
SortedSet	A	 	 	Ruby Class	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/set/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 SortedSet implements a Set that guarantees that its elements are yielded in sorted order (according to the return values of their #<=> methods) when iterating over them.All elements that are added to a SortedSet must respond to the <=> method for comparison.Also, all elements must be mutually comparable: el1 <=> el2 must not return nil for any elements el1 and el2, else an ArgumentError will be raised when iterating over the SortedSet.https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/set/rdoc/SortedSet.html

Shell	A	 	 	Ruby Class	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/shell/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 Shell implements an idiomatic Ruby interface for common UNIX shell commands.It provides users the ability to execute commands with filters and pipes, like sh/csh by using native facilities of Ruby.In this example we will create three tmpFile‘s in three different folders under the /tmp directory.This example is identical to the first, except we’re using Shell::CommandProcessor#transact.Shell::CommandProcessor#transact executes the given block against self, in this case sh; our Shell object. Within the block we can substitute sh.cd to cd, because the scope within the block uses sh already.In this example we will read the operating system file /etc/printcap, generated by cupsd, and then output it to a new file relative to the pwd of sh.https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/shell/rdoc/Shell.html

In this example we used the literal shortcut for Array.new.Wakou AoyamaAkinori MUSHA <knu@iDaemons.org>Akinori MUSHA <knu@iDaemons.org> (current maintainer)1: IEEE Std 1003.1-2008, 2016 Edition, the Shell & Utilities volumehttps://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/shellwords/rdoc/Shellwords.html

Singleton	A	 	 	Ruby Class	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/singleton/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 The Singleton module implements the Singleton pattern.To use Singleton, include the module in your class.This ensures that only one instance of Klass can be created.The instance is created at upon the first call of Klass.instance().This behavior is preserved under inheritance and cloning.This above is achieved by:Making Klass.new and Klass.allocate private.Overriding Klass.inherited(sub_klass) and Klass.clone() to ensure that the Singleton properties are kept when inherited and cloned.Providing the Klass.instance() method that returns the same object each time it is called.Overriding Klass._load(str) to call Klass.instance().Overriding Klass#clone and Klass#dup to raise TypeErrors to prevent cloning or duping.By default Singleton’s #_dump(depth) returns the empty string. Marshalling by default will strip state information, e.g. instance variables and taint state, from the instance. Classes using Singleton can provide custom _load(str) and _dump(depth) methods to retain some of the previous state of the instance.https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/singleton/rdoc/Singleton.html

Socket	A	 	 	Ruby Class	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/socket/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 Class Socket provides access to the underlying operating system socket implementations.  It can be used to provide more operating system specific functionality than the protocol-specific socket classes.The constants defined under Socket::Constants are also defined under Socket.  For example, Socket::AF_INET is usable as well as Socket::Constants::AF_INET.  See Socket::Constants for the list of constants.Sockets are endpoints of a bidirectional communication channel. Sockets can communicate within a process, between processes on the same machine or between different machines.  There are many types of socket: TCPSocket, UDPSocket or UNIXSocket for example.Sockets have their own vocabulary:domain: The family of protocols:Socket::PF_INETSocket::PF_INET6Socket::PF_UNIXetc.type: The type of communications between the two endpoints, typicallySocket::SOCK_STREAMSocket::SOCK_DGRAM.protocol: Typically zero. This may be used to identify a variant of a protocol.hostname: The identifier of a network interface:a string (hostname, IPv4 or IPv6 address or broadcast which specifies a broadcast address)a zero-length string which specifies INADDR_ANYan integer (interpreted as binary address in host byte order).Many of the classes, such as TCPSocket, UDPSocket or UNIXSocket, ease the use of sockets comparatively to the equivalent C programming interface.Let's create an internet socket using the IPv4 protocol in a C-like manner:You could also use the TCPSocket class:A simple server might look like this:A simple client may look like this:Ruby's Socket implementation raises exceptions based on the error generated by the system dependent implementation.  This is why the methods are documented in a way that isolate Unix-based system exceptions from Windows based exceptions. If more information on a particular exception is needed, please refer to the Unix manual pages or the Windows WinSock reference.Although the general way to create socket is ::new, there are several methods of socket creation for most cases.::tcp, TCPSocket.open::tcp_server_loop, TCPServer.open::unix, UNIXSocket.open::unix_server_loop, UNIXServer.openZach DennisSam RobertsProgramming Ruby from The Pragmatic Bookshelf.Much material in this documentation is taken with permission from Programming Ruby from The Pragmatic Bookshelf.https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/socket/rdoc/Socket.html

StringScanner	A	 	 	Ruby Class	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/strscan/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 StringScanner provides for lexical scanning operations on a String.  Here is an example of its usage:Scanning a string means remembering the position of a scan pointer, which is just an index.  The point of scanning is to move forward a bit at a time, so matches are sought after the scan pointer; usually immediately after it.Given the string "test string", here are the pertinent scan pointer positions:When you scan for a pattern (a regular expression), the match must occur at the character after the scan pointer.  If you use scan_until, then the match can occur anywhere after the scan pointer.  In both cases, the scan pointer moves just beyond the last character of the match, ready to scan again from the next character onwards.  This is demonstrated by the example above.There are other methods besides the plain scanners.  You can look ahead in the string without actually scanning.  You can access the most recent match. You can modify the string being scanned, reset or terminate the scanner, find out or change the position of the scan pointer, skip ahead, and so on.getchget_bytescanscan_untilskipskip_untilcheckcheck_untilexist?match?peekbeginning_of_line?

Syslog	A	 	 	Ruby Class	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/syslog/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 The syslog package provides a Ruby interface to the POSIX system logging facility.Syslog messages are typically passed to a central logging daemon. The daemon may filter them; route them into different files (usually found under /var/log); place them in SQL databases; forward them to centralized logging servers via TCP or UDP; or even alert the system administrator via email, pager or text message.Unlike application-level logging via Logger or Log4r, syslog is designed to allow secure tamper-proof logging.The syslog protocol is standardized in RFC 5424.https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/syslog/rdoc/Syslog.html

Syslog Logger	A	 	 	Ruby Class	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/syslog/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 Syslog::Logger is a Logger work-alike that logs via syslog instead of to a file.  You can use Syslog::Logger to aggregate logs between multiple machines.By default, Syslog::Logger uses the program name ‘ruby’, but this can be changed via the first argument to ::new.NOTE! You can only set the Syslog::Logger program name when you initialize Syslog::Logger for the first time.  This is a limitation of the way Syslog::Logger uses syslog (and in some ways, a limitation of the way syslog(3) works).  Attempts to change Syslog::Logger’s program name after the first initialization will be ignored.The following will log to syslogd on your local machine:Also the facility may be set to specify the facility level which will be used:You may need to perform some syslog.conf setup first.  For a BSD machine add the following lines to /etc/syslog.conf:Then touch /var/log/my_program.log and signal syslogd with a HUP (killall -HUP syslogd, on FreeBSD).If you wish to have logs automatically roll over and archive, see the newsyslog.conf(5) and newsyslog(8) man pages.https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/syslog/rdoc/Syslog/Logger.html

Tempfile	A	 	 	Ruby Class	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/tempfile/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 A utility class for managing temporary files. When you create a Tempfile object, it will create a temporary file with a unique filename. A Tempfile objects behaves just like a File object, and you can perform all the usual file operations on it: reading data, writing data, changing its permissions, etc. So although this class does not explicitly document all instance methods supported by File, you can in fact call any File instance method on a Tempfile object.When a Tempfile object is garbage collected, or when the Ruby interpreter exits, its associated temporary file is automatically deleted. This means that’s it’s unnecessary to explicitly delete a Tempfile after use, though it’s good practice to do so: not explicitly deleting unused Tempfiles can potentially leave behind large amounts of tempfiles on the filesystem until they’re garbage collected. The existence of these temp files can make it harder to determine a new Tempfile filename.Therefore, one should always call unlink or close in an ensure block, like this:On POSIX systems, it’s possible to unlink a file right after creating it, and before closing it. This removes the filesystem entry without closing the file handle, so it ensures that only the processes that already had the file handle open can access the file’s contents. It’s strongly recommended that you do this if you do not want any other processes to be able to read from or write to the Tempfile, and you do not need to know the Tempfile’s filename either.For example, a practical use case for unlink-after-creation would be this: you need a large byte buffer that’s too large to comfortably fit in RAM, e.g. when you’re writing a web server and you want to buffer the client’s file upload data.Please refer to unlink for more information and a code example.Tempfile’s filename picking method is both thread-safe and inter-process-safe: it guarantees that no other threads or processes will pick the same filename.Tempfile itself however may not be entirely thread-safe. If you access the same Tempfile object from multiple threads then you should protect it with a mutex.https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/tempfile/rdoc/Tempfile.html

We can also use our own object.parse also accepts an optional block. You can use this block to specify how to handle the year component of the date. This is specifically designed for handling two digit years. For example, if you wanted to treat all two digit years prior to 70 as the year 2000+ you could write this:strptime works similar to parse except that instead of using a heuristic to detect the format of the input string, you provide a second argument that describes the format of the string.

TSort	A	 	 	Ruby Class	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/tsort/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 TSort implements topological sorting using Tarjan's algorithm for strongly connected components.TSort is designed to be able to be used with any object which can be interpreted as a directed graph.TSort requires two methods to interpret an object as a graph, #tsort_each_node and tsort_each_child.#tsort_each_node is used to iterate for all nodes over a graph.#tsort_each_child is used to iterate for child nodes of a given node.The equality of nodes are defined by eql? and hash since TSort uses Hash internally.The following example demonstrates how to mix the TSort module into an existing class (in this case, Hash). Here, we’re treating each key in the hash as a node in the graph, and so we simply alias the required tsort_each_node method to Hash’s each_key method. For each key in the hash, the associated value is an array of the node’s child nodes. This choice in turn leads to our implementation of the required tsort_each_child method, which fetches the array of child nodes and then iterates over that array using the user-supplied block.A very simple `make’ like tool can be implemented as follows:‘tsort.rb’ is wrong name because this library uses Tarjan’s algorithm for strongly connected components. Although ‘strongly_connected_components.rb’ is correct but too long.Tarjan, “Depth First Search and Linear Graph Algorithms”,SIAM Journal on Computing, Vol. 1, No. 2, pp. 146-160, June 1972.https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/tsort/rdoc/TSort.html

Symbols are immutable and cannot be garbage collected.Let’s see it in action:You can see the local variable omg stayed, although its reference in our hash object was garbage collected, along with the rest of the keys and values.

WEBrickWEB server toolkit.¶ ↑	A	 	 	Ruby Class	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/webrick/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 frozen_string_literal: falseWEBrick is an HTTP server toolkit that can be configured as an HTTPS server, a proxy server, and a virtual-host server.  WEBrick features complete logging of both server operations and HTTP access.  WEBrick supports both basic and digest authentication in addition to algorithms not in RFC 2617.A WEBrick server can be composed of multiple WEBrick servers or servlets to provide differing behavior on a per-host or per-path basis.  WEBrick includes servlets for handling CGI scripts, ERB pages, Ruby blocks and directory listings.WEBrick also includes tools for daemonizing a process and starting a process at a higher privilege level and dropping permissions.To create a new WEBrick::HTTPServer that will listen to connections on port 8000 and serve documents from the current user’s public_html folder:To run the server you will need to provide a suitable shutdown hook as starting the server blocks the current thread:The easiest way to have a server perform custom operations is through WEBrick::HTTPServer#mount_proc. The block given will be called with a WEBrick::HTTPRequest with request info and a WEBrick::HTTPResponse which must be filled in appropriately:Remember that server.mount_proc must precede server.start.Advanced custom behavior can be obtained through mounting a subclass of WEBrick::HTTPServlet::AbstractServlet. Servlets provide more modularity when writing an HTTP server than mount_proc allows.  Here is a simple servlet:To initialize the servlet you mount it on the server:See WEBrick::HTTPServlet::AbstractServlet for more details.A server can act as a virtual host for multiple host names.  After creating the listening host, additional hosts that do not listen can be created and attached as virtual hosts:If no :DocumentRoot is provided and no servlets or procs are mounted on the main server it will return 404 for all URLs.To create an HTTPS server you only need to enable SSL and provide an SSL certificate name:This will start the server with a self-generated self-signed certificate. The certificate will be changed every time the server is restarted.To create a server with a pre-determined key and certificate you can provide them:WEBrick can act as a proxy server:See WEBrick::HTTPProxy for further details including modifying proxied responses.WEBrick provides both Basic and Digest authentication for regular and proxy servers.  See WEBrick::HTTPAuth, WEBrick::HTTPAuth::BasicAuth and WEBrick::HTTPAuth::DigestAuth.WEBrick can be run as a production server for small loads.To start a WEBrick server as a daemon simple run WEBrick::Daemon.start before starting the server.WEBrick can be started as one user to gain permission to bind to port 80 or 443 for serving HTTP or HTTPS traffic then can drop these permissions for regular operation.  To listen on all interfaces for HTTP traffic:Then drop privileges:Then create a server that does not listen by default:Then overwrite the listening sockets with the port 80 sockets:WEBrick can separately log server operations and end-user access.  For server operations:For user access logging:See WEBrick::AccessLog for further log formats.To rotate logs in WEBrick on a HUP signal (like syslogd can send), open the log file in ‘a+’ mode (as above) and trap ‘HUP’ to reopen the log file:Author: IPR – Internet Programming with Ruby – writersCopyright © 2000 TAKAHASHI Masayoshi, GOTOU YUUZOU Copyright © 2002 Internet Programming with Ruby writers.

WEBrick HTTPAuth	A	 	 	Ruby Class	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/webrick/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 HTTPAuth provides both basic and digest authentication.To enable authentication for requests in WEBrick you will need a user database and an authenticator.  To start, here’s an Htpasswd database for use with a DigestAuth authenticator:The :Realm is used to provide different access to different groups across several resources on a server.  Typically you’ll need only one realm for a server.This database can be used to create an authenticator:To authenticate a request call authenticate with a request and response object in a servlet:For digest authentication the authenticator must not be created every request, it must be passed in as an option via WEBrick::HTTPServer#mount.https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/webrick/rdoc/WEBrick/HTTPAuth.html

Doing so is unsafe and could allow malicious input to execute arbitrary code inside your application. Please see doc/security.rdoc for more information.Syck was the original for YAML implementation in Ruby’s standard library developed by why the lucky stiff.You can still use Syck, if you prefer, for parsing and emitting YAML, but you must install the ‘syck’ gem now in order to use it.In older Ruby versions, ie. <= 1.9, Syck is still provided, however it was completely removed with the release of Ruby 2.0.0.For more advanced details on the implementation see Psych, and also check out yaml.org for spec details and other helpful information.Psych is maintained by Aaron Patterson on github: github.com/tenderlove/psychSyck can also be found on github: github.com/tenderlove/syckhttps://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/yaml/rdoc/YAML.html

Zlib	A	 	 	Ruby Class	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/zlib/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 This module provides access to the zlib library. Zlib is designed to be a portable, free, general-purpose, legally unencumbered – that is, not covered by any patents – lossless data-compression library for use on virtually any computer hardware and operating system.The zlib compression library provides in-memory compression and decompression functions, including integrity checks of the uncompressed data.The zlib compressed data format is described in RFC 1950, which is a wrapper around a deflate stream which is described in RFC 1951.The library also supports reading and writing files in gzip (.gz) format with an interface similar to that of IO. The gzip format is described in RFC 1952 which is also a wrapper around a deflate stream.The zlib format was designed to be compact and fast for use in memory and on communications channels. The gzip format was designed for single-file compression on file systems, has a larger header than zlib to maintain directory information, and uses a different, slower check method than zlib.See your system’s zlib.h for further information about zlibUsing the wrapper to compress strings with default parameters is quite simple:Zlib::DeflateZlib::InflateZlib::ZStreamZlib::ErrorZlib::StreamEndZlib::NeedDictZlib::DataErrorZlib::StreamErrorZlib::MemErrorZlib::BufErrorZlib::VersionError(if you have GZIP_SUPPORT)Zlib::GzipReaderZlib::GzipWriterZlib::GzipFileZlib::GzipFile::ErrorZlib::GzipFile::LengthErrorZlib::GzipFile::CRCErrorZlib::GzipFile::NoFooterhttps://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/zlib/rdoc/Zlib.html

GzipReader should be used as an IO, or -IO-like, object.The following methods in Zlib::GzipReader are just like their counterparts in IO, but they raise Zlib::Error or Zlib::GzipFile::Error exception if an error was found in the gzip file.eacheach_lineeach_bytegetsgetclinenolineno=readreadcharreadlinereadlinesungetcBe careful of the footer of the gzip file. A gzip file has the checksum of pre-compressed data in its footer. GzipReader checks all uncompressed data against that checksum at the following cases, and if it fails, raises Zlib::GzipFile::NoFooter, Zlib::GzipFile::CRCError, or Zlib::GzipFile::LengthError exception.When an reading request is received beyond the end of file (the end of compressed data). That is, when #read, #gets, or some other methods for reading returns nil.When Zlib::GzipFile#close method is called after the object reaches the end of file.When #unused method is called after the object reaches the end of file.The rest of the methods are adequately described in their own documentation.https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/zlib/rdoc/Zlib/GzipReader.html
Zlib GzipWriter	A	 	 	Ruby Class	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/zlib/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 Zlib::GzipWriter is a class for writing gzipped files.  GzipWriter should be used with an instance of IO, or IO-like, object.Following two example generate the same result.To make like gzip(1) does, run following:NOTE: Due to the limitation of Ruby's finalizer, you must explicitly close GzipWriter objects by Zlib::GzipFile#close etc.  Otherwise, GzipWriter will be not able to write the gzip footer and will generate a broken gzip file.https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/zlib/rdoc/Zlib/GzipWriter.html
Zlib Inflate	A	 	 	Ruby Class	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/zlib/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 Zlib:Inflate is the class for decompressing compressed data.

Zlib ZStream	A	 	 	Ruby Class	 	https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/zlib/rdoc/index.html	 	 	 	 Zlib::ZStream is the abstract class for the stream which handles the compressed data. The operations are defined in the subclasses: Zlib::Deflate for compression, and Zlib::Inflate for decompression.An instance of Zlib::ZStream has one stream (struct zstream in the source) and two variable-length buffers which associated to the input (next_in) of the stream and the output (next_out) of the stream. In this document, "input buffer" means the buffer for input, and "output buffer" means the buffer for output.Data input into an instance of Zlib::ZStream are temporally stored into the end of input buffer, and then data in input buffer are processed from the beginning of the buffer until no more output from the stream is produced (i.e. until #avail_out > 0 after processing).  During processing, output buffer is allocated and expanded automatically to hold all output data.Some particular instance methods consume the data in output buffer and return them as a String.Here is an ascii art for describing above:If an error occurs during processing input buffer, an exception which is a subclass of Zlib::Error is raised.  At that time, both input and output buffer keep their conditions at the time when the error occurs.Many of the methods in this class are fairly low-level and unlikely to be of interest to users.  In fact, users are unlikely to use this class directly; rather they will be interested in Zlib::Inflate and Zlib::Deflate.The higher level methods are listed below.total_intotal_outdata_typeadlerresetfinishfinished?closeclosed?https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.0/libdoc/zlib/rdoc/Zlib/ZStream.html
