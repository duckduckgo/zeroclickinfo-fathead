How to do a Safe Mode boot on a Mini without a wired keyboard?	A										As posted in answer to the question you asked in the other thread: There is generally very poor luck with PS2-USB adapters with Mac minis (indeed any Mac) so the chances are your problem is that the keyboard is simply not being recognised at startup. Often it is MacOS that had to determine unusual keyboards, and by the time it gets to the point where it does this, it's passed the point at which the keyboard could be used for modifying the boot process.I think it best to buy or borrow a standard USB keyboard. Almost any will do (not the new aluminium Mac keyboard, but any previous Apple USB keyboards, and most Windows ones). If a PC keyboard, ALT will be the option key and Windows will be the command key.	https://discussions.apple.com/thread/1454230

How do you ungroup apps?	A										When you say 'ungroup' I presume you mean separate them out of their grouped folders. There are two ways to deal with this. You can do it on the iPhone itself or you can do it from within iTunes.  To do this from within iTunes:Plug the iPhone into your PC or Mac using the supplied dock connector cable.  Select the iPhone in the sidebar on the left. Select the Apps tab in the main part of the window. You will see a list of your installed apps and a representation of what your iPhone's screens look like. Double click on the group folders. Now you can click and drag the app icons out of the folders. You can even drag any app icon in any order that you want to customize the arrangement. When you're done click on the sync button to send these changes to your iPhone. To do this on your iPhone:Hold your finger down on any app icon until they all start to wiggle. At this point you can hold your finger down on the icons and drag them around the screen to re-arrange them. For the ones in folders, tap on the folder. you can now drag those icons out of the folders on to the main screen. Once you've dragged them all out of folders you can continue to drag them around in any order you choose.  Once you are satisfied with their placement, hit the home button to stop the wiggle. Your now ready to continue to use your iPhone.	https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3153829

Delete a movie on ipad2, but keep it in my iTunes library.	A										If the movie is in iTunes on your computer then launch the videos app and tap and hold down on the movie icon until the X to delete pops up. Tap the X to remove the movie. When you sync with iTunes the next time - Uncheck the movie so it will not sync. If you auto sync - let the sync complete and then click on your iPad name on the left side under "Devices" - then click on the movies tab in  iTunes on the right window. Uncheck the movie that you want to remove and then click on Apply in the lower right corner of iTunes. The movie will no longer sync as long as you keep it unchecked - but it will still be stored in iTunes on your computer. If you have not transferred the movie into iTunes yet - sync with iTunes to put the movie into your iTunes library or you can click on your iPad name on the left side of the iTunes window and go to File>Transfer purchases - from the iTunes menu - while your iPad is connected to iTunes.	https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3832847

Is there a way to see a map of a workout route tracked by the GPS.	A										They have maps now that are embedded in the Activity app. If you logged a workout with the watch (any one as mine is a first gen), it will track via the phones gps or the watch gps if so equipped. To find it, go to your workout and select it. Scroll all the way to the bottom and you’ll see a map thumbnail. Click it. 	https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7017138
