CCleaner for iOS v1.0 it's official ? (iTunes Store)	A										<p><b>Answered by Kurt Lang (Mar 22, 2015)</b></p><p>Sorry, I should be more precise. In Apple's iOS (iPhones and iPads) the OS is locked down. All apps are fully sandboxed. They can only alter data within their own application package. Translation, nothing is allowed to touch the OS or any of its files.</p><p>The only thing this app could "clean" are very simple things like clearing Safari's cache and other browsing data. Something you can do yourself for free by going to the Settings.</p>	https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6887788
Convert MP4 to MP3 (iTunes for Mac)	A										<p><b>Answered by Mike Johnson12 (Sep 2, 2012)</b></p><p>Go iTunes prefs&gt;General - at the bottom is 'Import Settings' - change the 'Import Using' to whatever mp3 setting you want - then select a tune in iTunes and from the 'Advanced' option in the menu bar select 'Create  MP3 version'.</p><p>This will create a .mp3 version and the original .mp4 will still be there.</p><p>MJ</p>	https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4261423
Delete a movie on ipad2, but keep it in my iTunes library. (iPad)	A										<p><b>Answered by Demo (Mar 26, 2012)</b></p><p>If the movie is in iTunes on your computer then launch the videos app and tap and hold down on the movie icon until the X to delete pops up. Tap the X to remove the movie.</p><p>When you sync with iTunes the next time - Uncheck the movie so it will not sync. If you auto sync - let the sync complete and then click on your iPad name on the left side under "Devices" - then click on the movies tab in  iTunes on the right window. Uncheck the movie that you want to remove and then click on Apply in the lower right corner of iTunes. The movie will no longer sync as long as you keep it unchecked - but it will still be stored in iTunes on your computer.</p><p>If you have not transferred the movie into iTunes yet - sync with iTunes to put the movie into your iTunes library or you can click on your iPad name on the left side of the iTunes window and go to File&gt;Transfer purchases - from the iTunes menu - while your iPad is connected to iTunes.</p>	https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3832847

I tried that and it did not recognize after failing from the Firware.  I plan on tryong to get up the USB tomarrow from the start and see if I loose connectivity.

How do you ungroup apps? (iPhone)	A										<p><b>Answered by Gino Cerullo (Jul 1, 2011)</b></p><p>When you say 'ungroup' I presume you mean separate them out of their grouped folders.</p><p>There are two ways to deal with this. You can do it on the iPhone itself or you can do it from within iTunes.</p><p><strong>To do this from within iTunes:</strong></p><p>Plug the iPhone into your PC or Mac using the supplied dock connector cable.</p><p>Select the iPhone in the sidebar on the left. Select the Apps tab in the main part of the window. You will see a list of your installed apps and a representation of what your iPhone's screens look like.</p><p>Double click on the group folders. Now you can click and drag the app icons out of the folders. You can even drag any app icon in any order that you want to customize the arrangement.</p><p>When you're done click on the sync button to send these changes to your iPhone.</p><p><strong>To do this on your iPhone:</strong></p><p>Hold your finger down on any app icon until they all start to wiggle. At this point you can hold your finger down on the icons and drag them around the screen to re-arrange them.</p><p>For the ones in folders, tap on the folder. you can now drag those icons out of the folders on to the main screen. Once you've dragged them all out of folders you can continue to drag them around in any order you choose.</p><p>Once you are satisfied with their placement, hit the home button to stop the wiggle. Your now ready to continue to use your iPhone.</p>	https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3153829
How to do a Safe Mode boot on a Mini without a wired keyboard? (Mac mini)	A										<p><b>Answered by AndyO (Mar 24, 2008)</b></p>As posted in answer to the question you asked in the other thread: There is generally very poor luck with PS2-USB adapters with Mac minis (indeed any Mac) so the chances are your problem is that the keyboard is simply not being recognised at startup. Often it is MacOS that had to determine unusual keyboards, and by the time it gets to the point where it does this, it's passed the point at which the keyboard could be used for modifying the boot process.<br/><br/>I think it best to buy or borrow a standard USB keyboard. Almost any will do (not the new aluminium Mac keyboard, but any previous Apple USB keyboards, and most Windows ones). If a PC keyboard, ALT will be the option key and Windows will be the command key.	https://discussions.apple.com/thread/1454230

LATE 2012 27 inch IMAC Power Off Randomly (iMac)	A										<p><b>Answered by poikkeus1 (Jun 1, 2015)</b></p><p>I won't request an Entrecheck report, since I'm pretty sure I know what the problem is. And how you might resolve it.</p><p>You're a graphic designer, so your machine probably performs some intensive projects. When your machine's temperature rises above a certain point, your iMac automatically shuts off. In fact, I can pretty much guarantee that the heat is concentrated on the CPU Cores and GPU Die.</p><p>The solution is to reduce the overall heat load. Using your machine intermittently doesn't make much sense as a means of reducing heat. But there are some good solutions. My personal favorite is iStat Menus http://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/</p><p>Macs Fan Control http://www.crystalidea.com/macs-fan-control?ref=macupdate is said to be very good.</p>	https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7067231
Mac mini 32 bit or 64 bit? (Boot Camp)	A										<p><b>Answered by mende1 (Jan 6, 2013)</b></p><p>Your Mac mini supports both, but Boot Camp isn't compatible with Windows 8 at the moment (although I see some new MacBooks Pro that can run Windows 8 now).</p><p>I recommend you to wait until Apple releases new drivers, so you will get the best performance of Windows 8. If you can't wait, you can install it on a virtual machine that you can create with Parallels, VMware Fusion or VirtualBox, or you can also install Windows 7</p>	https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4677668
