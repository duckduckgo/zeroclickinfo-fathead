Can't restore or update iPhone 5 - TATSU declined to authorize	A										<section class="prog__container"><p>for anyone else who comes across this or something similar. It turned out that my hosts file had an entry to gs.apple.com which was causing apple&apos;s signing (TATSU) server request to fail. So you need to check your hosts file on the computer you are running iTunes on to see if there are any entries to gs.apple.com and then either remove those lines or comment them out by placing a # at the start of the line. like so <strong>#gs.apple.com 74.454.656.343</strong>&#xA0; easiest way is via terminal. look up how to edit host file if you don&apos;t know how. on my mac the host file was located at /etc/hosts&#xA0; once in terminal: <strong>sudo nano /etc/hosts</strong> will open an editor, once changed control x will exit, type y when propted to save then enter to save your changes to the hosts file. all done.</p></section>	https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7763286#thread-message-31018018

I&apos;m sure there are dozens of them out there. You could browse the library of computer programming titles at Amazon.com. They give a little information about many of their books. Or go to the local library and large bookstores that carry such titles. That&apos;s what I do.

MacBook Air or Pro	A										<section class="prog__container"><p>Hi,</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>I did this comparison awhile back between the 2016 13&quot; four Thunderbolt 3/USB-C port MBP and the 2015 15&quot; MBP.</p><p>http://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro?product=MJLQ2LL/A&amp;step=config# </p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>I&apos;ve added some notes for comparison to the newest 13&quot; MacBook Air, in addition to the 13&quot; 2016 MBP if you might be interested in that.</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>The 15&quot;, obviously, has a larger display.</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>It also has 16GBs of RAM vs 8 for the 13&quot; (including the MBA, which has a max of 8GBs of RAM) which will become more and more important over time as apps and OSes get more and more RAM hungry. RAM is not upgradeable in these models.</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>The 15&quot; is a bit slower doing single core (light weight work) tasks (it&apos;s over twice as fast as the MacBook Air), but is almost twice the speed of the 13&quot; in multi core tasks (it&apos;s over twice the speed of the MBA).</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>The 15&quot; has a full array of ports/connections (two USB 3, two Thunderbolt 2, HDMI, SDXC slot, digital/analog headphone jack, MagSafe 2 connection), while the 13&quot; has four Thunderbolt 3/USB-C ports which will require adapters (rather costly and something extra to hookup/carry) for many peripherals (the MBA has two USB 3 ports, 1 Thunderbolt 2 port, and an SDXC slot).</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>The 15&quot; is the last in a line of tried and true MBPs. The 13&quot; is the first in the line of problem plagued MBPs; many people find the Touch Bar to be more of a gimmick than useful, and it also has its problems (this doesn&apos;t apply to the MBA).</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>In addition to the comparison to the top of the line 13&quot; MBP, a few notes about the MBA.</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>I think you&apos;re going to want 512GBs of flash storage and 16GBs of RAM. The MBA maxes out at 8GBs of RAM. It does not have a Retinal display, while the 15&quot; does. The MBA is definitely smaller and lighter.</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>13&quot; MBA cost with 8GBs of RAM and 512GBs of flash storage: $1399</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>15&quot; MBP cost with 16GBs of RAM and 512GBs of flash storage: $2199</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>So the MBA is definitely less expensive, and it should do the job for you, just slower, and with no Retina display, and less RAM (so you can&apos;t have as many apps or windows/tabs open at the same time).</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>You asked about value. No comparison. I think the 2015 15&quot; MBP is by far the best value Apple offers in notebooks. Given its great speed advantage over the MBA and 16GBs of RAM, I think it will easily be more functional years beyond the MBA.</p></section>	https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7933712#thread-message-31671631

ipad memory management - ibooks, photos	A										<section class="prog__container"><p>Hi Bernd, I am surprised you did not address your responses to me as I am the one that pointed you in the right direction, the bloated Other!!!&#xA0; You are very much correct, Apple devices can be a pain, between my wife and I we own 5 of them, 2 iPhones, 2 iPads and a MacBookPro. I find that the hardware on my MBP (and also the iPads) is unbeatable, my display, trackpad, keyboard, etc. are far better than on my Dell PC, however as far as operating systems go, my wife and I still use our 2 Dell W7 PCs as our main working platforms (paid $650 for each of the Dells and $1,300 for the MBP I am on now so go figure).</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>At any rate, I can help you with your issue, low space and all.....&#xA0; Another drawback of iOS is that if you sync to a different PC, iTunes will wipe out any purchases you made under the other iTunes Library <strong>in your iPad</strong>, it will not wipe them out on your original library (in case you are interested in the reason, just ask me and I will explain, it has to do with profits). As long as you are not concerned about purchased material (songs downloaded from the iTunes Store, books, etc.) the backup to the other PC will work.</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>I can indeed understand why you are &quot;unhappy&quot; but here is how to resolve it. First realize that the backup that you have on your other PC will contain all your native and free apps, all your pictures in Camera Roll (as long as you are not using iCloud Photo Library) and all your settings., data, etc. As I said, it will not let you restore purchased material from the iTunes Store (don&apos;t know what it will do with purchased material from 3rd parties like Amazon). If this is not a concern then do as follow:</p><p>1. As I understand it, you now have a good backup on another PC.</p><p>2. Disconnect your iPad from the PC and plug it to its charger on the wall. On your iPad, go to Settings &gt; General &gt; Reset &gt; Erase All Content and Settings and then let it complete. It will take time.</p><p>3. The steps above will wipe your iPad clean including getting rid of that record breaking Other (I will have to update my record book). It will also install a fresh / clean copy of the newest iOS, 8.4.1, with no corruption.</p><p>4. The process above will ask you if you want to set up as New or from iCloud backup. Choose New.</p><p>5. After it completes, connect your pad to the new computer where your backup resides and then restore the backup. You should now have a clean iPad, a minimal Other with likely 300-500 MBs if that, and all the settings and apps I mentioned above.</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>There is a remote possibility that restoring the backup will bring back the corruption (unlikely) and if so you will have to repeat the process above, choosing New again but not restoring and thus having to set everything from scratch - this is not likely but at least you will have a working iPad.</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>Please post back and let me know how you fair out. I am in Houston, Texas, 7 am here - I suspect are in the EU likely 2 pm there. I will be monitoring this site for further posts in case you have questions....</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Carlos, my real name instead of ElCPU....</p></section>	https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7204261#thread-message-28850117

A new Bug or a New Feature? The "x" on Faces Circles is Missing in Photos on macOS 10.12.4	A										<section class="prog__container"><p>I have also &quot;lost&quot; the X on the face circle. Saw this already in the beta versions of 10.12.4.</p><p>Very annoying, as it breaks my workflow of putting names on people.</p><p>I usually import photos, put them in an album (one for each event) and remove the unwanted photos.</p><p>Then wait 1 or two days for the scanning to do its job.</p><p>Then open the new album, and name all circles which haven&apos;t been named automatically.</p><p>I also add the missing circles (faces not recognized).</p><p>And I removed all unwanted faces with the X.</p><p>From time to time I go to the people albums and click &quot;+&quot; to check the recognized but not named faces.</p><p>There I see many empty/gray rectangles of the faces that I got ride of by clicking &quot;X&quot;.</p><p>Between these I see some other to-be-named faces that I have missed above. I add them to the view of people albums and name them.</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>As I cannot remove faces anymore using &quot;x&quot;, the view with the list of recognized but not named faces is not useless of for me. In this view, you cannot double-click on a face to see to which photo/context it below (often necessary to put a name on face of someone you do not see every day). I would have to add each face from this view to the view of people albums where you can check the associated photo, to either name or hide the face. I do not want to do this, as I would have to hide a lot, and I do not know what the consequences are. In the past hiding a people could hide a photo from memories. I think it is not the case anymore. But as long as Apple doesn&apos;t really know what &quot;hide&quot; is supposed to do, I rather not use it.</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>So I will still continue naming faces directly on photos.</p><p>But I won&apos;t use anymore the view of unnamed faces. And maybe it is better to avoid it. Whenever I open and browse it, my MBP starts to heat &amp; fan aggressively until I close it again and wait for a few minutes.</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>The missing X is also a pity for another reason:</p><p>I constantly display names on the photos. As I cannot remove circles anymore, I have to live with the constant display of the &quot;unnamed&quot; circles.</p></section>	https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7904227#thread-message-31559062

Import photos from Canon cameras not working in Mac OS X 10.10 Yosemite	A										<section class="prog__container"><p>It is a problem with Yosemite AND the Canon drivers for the older Canon cameras. However, the workaround that I shared here (changing the communications type on the camera) provides a workable solution, at least for my old Canon EOS Digital Rebel. And since my camera is older than your Canon Rebel Tli, this solution should work for you too. You can check for Canon updates to the drivers for your camera on Canon&apos;s website here: http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/support. Imports seem to be faster now with Yosemite 10.10.3 and Photos, but it is still slow to import RAW images from my Canon EOS Digital Rebel. This is more a function of the processor on the camera (and perhaps the type of USB connection), I believe. Buying a new Canon camera would probably solve everything, and as much as I wish that were an option for me, it is not practical right now. Besides, my old Canon EOS Digital Rebel serves me well for what I need to do with it. Hope this helps.</p></section>	https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6658895#thread-message-28158405

In that case, LOOKUP (and VLOOKUP or MATCH, when not set to require an exact match) will take the &apos;close&apos; match and return what could be a wrong value.</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>Regards,</p><p>Barry</p></section>	https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7931704#thread-message-31665839
