How to Add Gloss in Illustrator	A									[[Image:http://www.wikihow.com/images/8/84/Add-Gloss-in-Illustrator-Step-10-Version-2.jpg]]	<section class="prog__container"><p>Adobe Illustrator was created in 1986 and has since become a very popular vector-graphics editing software. It is especially prized in graphic design firms for its aid in creating logos, 3D graphics and published documents. The user can add textures, typography or gloss to make the document multi-layered and 3 dimensional. Adding gloss or shine to an object allows you to mimic the way light hits the image. Just like looking at a photograph with a glossy finish, the light does not reflect upon the finish the same way in all parts of the picture, it has a shine or glare in a particular place where the light hits it directly. To recreate gloss, you need to understand how shadow and light hit glossy objects. Practice holding a curved or rectangular glossy object up to the light to understand how light hits it, and then use some Adobe Illustrator tools to help you create the illusion of shine and add more dimension to your object. This article will tell you how to add gloss in Illustrator.</p><span class="prog__sub"><ol><li> - Open your Adobe Illustrator application.</li><li> - Open an existing document or create a new print or web document in the dialogue box that appears.</li><li> - Select the object to which you want to add a glossy shine.</li><li> - Copy the object by selecting it with your cursor, clicking the "Edit" menu in the horizontal toolbar and then selecting "Copy.</li><li> - Create a new layer in your document above the top layer of the object.</li><li> - Add a shape around your object in the new layer.</li><li> - Scroll over to the right vertical toolbar, click the "Gradient" box and select the "Transparency" tab to the right of the gradients, or go to the Window menu and click "Transparency.</li><li> - Double click in the empty gray square to the right of the white box.</li><li> - Select the text again.</li><li> - Save your document to record the glossy finish you just added.</li></ol></section>	http://www.wikihow.com/Add-Gloss-in-Illustrator
