a		http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-a-element	If the a element has an href attribute, then it represents a hyperlink (a hypertext anchor). If the a element has no href attribute, then the element represents a placeholder for where a link might otherwise have been placed, if it had been relevant. The target, rel, media, hreflang, and type attributes must be omitted if the href attribute is not present. 	\\n<a href="http://html5doctor.com/author/jacko/">Jack Osborne</a>\\n			
abbr		http://html5doctor.com/the-abbr-element/	Represents an abbreviation or acronym. The optional title attribute may be used to provide an expansion of the abbreviation. If specified, the title attribute must contain an expansion of the abbreviation and nothing else. 	\\nThe <abbr title="Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group">WHATWG</abbr> started working on HTML5 in 2004.\\n			
address		http://html5doctor.com/the-address-element/	Represents the contact information for its enclosing section. If it is a child of the body element, then it applies to the document as a whole. 	\\n<address>Jack Osborne</address>\\n			
area		http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-area-element	The area element represents either a hyperlink with some text and a corresponding area on an image map, or a dead area on an image map. If the area element has no href attribute, then the area represented by the element cannot be selected, and the alt attribute must be omitted. 	\\n<img src="floorplan.png" usemap="#rooms" alt="1 bedroom, a kitchen, lounge and bathroom">\\n\\n<map name="rooms">\\n\\t<area shape="rect" coords="20,20,140,140" href="bedroom.html" alt="Bedroom">\\n\\t<area shape="rect" coords="20,140,140,280" href="lounge.html" alt="Lounge">\\n\\t<area shape="poly" coords="140,140,140,280,280,140" href="kitchen.html" alt="Kitchen">\\n\\t<area shape="rect" coords="140,20,280,140" href="bathroom.html" alt="Bathroom">\\n</map>\\n			
article		http://html5doctor.com/the-article-element/	Represents a section of a page that consists of a composition that forms an independent part of a document, page, or site. This could be a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, a Web log entry, a user-submitted comment, or any other independent item of content. 	\\n<article>\\n\\t<header>\\n\\t\\t<h4><a href="#comment-2" rel="bookmark">Comment #2</a>\\n\\t\\tby <a href="http://example.com/">Jack Osborne</a></h4>\\n\\n\\t\\t<time datetime="2007-08-29T13:58Z">August 29th, 2007 at 13:58</time>\\n\\t</header>\\n\\t<p>Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas.

aside		http://html5doctor.com/aside-revisited/	Represents a section of a page consisting of content that is tangentially related to the content around the aside element, and which could be considered separate from that content. Such sections are often represented as sidebars in printed typography. 	\\n<aside>\\n\\t<h2>Blogroll</h2>\\n\\t<ul>\\n\\t\\t\\t<li><a href="#">My Friend</a></li>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t<li><a href="#">My Other Friend</a></li>\\n\\t\\t\\t<li><a href="#">My Best Friend</a></li>\\n\\t</ul>\\n\\n</aside>\\n\\t\\t\\n			
audio		http://html5doctor.com/native-audio-in-the-browser/	Represents a sound or audio stream. Content may be nested inside the audio element. User agents should not show this content to the user. Authors should use this content to force older browsers to use a legacy audio plugin or to inform the user of how to access the audio content. Supported audio codecs: 	\\n<audio src="music.oga" controls>\\n\\t<a href="music.oga">Download song</a>\\n\\n</audio>\\n			
b		http://html5doctor.com/i-b-em-strong-element/	Represents a span of text to be stylistically offset from the normal prose without conveying any extra importance. Examples are key words in a document abstract, product names in a review, or other spans of text whose typical typographic presentation is bold. The b element should be used as a last resort when no other element is more appropriate. In particular, headings should use the h1 to h6 elements, stress emphasis should use the em element, importance should be denoted with the strong element, and text marked or highlighted should use the mark element. 	\\n<b class="character">Deckard</b>: <i class="voiceover">The report would be routine retirement of a replicant which didn't make me feel any better about shooting a woman in the back. There it was again. Feeling, in myself. For her, for Rachael.</i>\\n			
base		http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-base-element	The base element allows authors to specify the document base URL for the purposes of resolving relative URLs, and the name of the default browsing context for the purposes of following hyperlinks. The element does not represent any content beyond this information. There must be no more than one base element per document. A base element must have either an href attribute, a target attribute, or both. 	\\n<head>\\n  <title>The Company</title>\\n  <base href="http://www.example.com/">\\n</head>\\n			
bdi		http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/text-level-semantics.html#the-bdi-element	The bdi element represents a span of text that is to be isolated from its surroundings for the purposes of bidirectional text formatting. 	\\n<ul>\\n  <li><bdi>johnsmith</bdi> joined the site</li>\\n  <li><bdi>the_guru</bdi> posted "February update"</li>\\n\\n  <li><bdi>????</bdi> commented on "Getting started with HTML5"</li>\\n</ul>\\n			
bdo		http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/text-level-semantics.html#the-bdo-element	The bdo element represents explicit text directionality formatting control for its children. It allows authors to override the Unicode bidirectional algorithm by explicitly specifying a direction override. 	\\n\\n\\n  <p><bdo dir="rtl">Don't cheat by reading this in a mirror!</bdo></p>\\n\\n			
blockquote		http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-blockquote-element	The blockquote element represents a section that is quoted from another source. Content inside a blockquote must be quoted from another source, whose address, if it has one, may be cited in the cite attribute. 	\\n<blockquote>What we have here is a quotation from another source\\n</blockquote>\\n			
body		http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-body-element-0	The body element represents the main content of the document. 	\\n<body id="index">\\n\\t<p>content</p>\\n</body>\\n			
br		http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-br-element	The br element represents a line break. br elements must be used only for line breaks that are actually part of the content, as in poems or addresses. br elements must not be used for separating thematic groups in a paragraph. 	\\n<br />\\n			
button		http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-button-element	The button element represents a button. If the element is not disabled, then the user agent should allow the user to activate the button. 	\\n<button>Do something!</button>\\n			
canvas		http://html5doctor.com/an-introduction-to-the-canvas-2d-api/	Represents a resolution-dependent bitmap canvas, which can be used for rendering graphs, game graphics, or other visual images on the fly. Authors should not use the canvas element in a document when a more suitable element is available. For example, it is inappropriate to use a canvas element to render a page heading. If the desired presentation of the heading is graphically intense, it should be marked up using appropriate elements (typically h1) and then styled using CSS and supporting technologies such as XBL. When authors use the canvas element, they must also provide content that, when presented to the user, conveys essentially the same function or purpose as the bitmap canvas. This content should be nested within the canvas element as a fallback. 	\\n<canvas id="myCanvas" width="300" height="150">\\nFallback content, in case the browser does not support Canvas.\\n</canvas>\\n			
caption		http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-caption-element	The caption element represents the title of the table that is its parent, if it has a parent and that is a table element. When a table element is the only content in a figure element other than the figcaption, the caption element should be omitted in favor of the figcaption. 	\\n<table><caption>Animals on our farm</caption>\\n<colgroup>\\n\\t<col class="column1" />\\n\\t<col class="column2" />\\n\\n\\t<col class="column3-4" span="2" />\\n</colgroup>\\n<tr>\\n\\t<th>dog</th>\\n\\t<th>cat</th>\\n\\n\\t<th>horse</th>\\n\\t<th>iguana</th>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n\\t<td>5</td>\\n\\n\\t<td>2</td>\\n\\t<td>10</td>\\n\\t<td>500</td>\\n</tr>\\n\\n...\\n</table>\\n			
cite		http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-cite-element	The cite element represents the title of a work (e.g. a book, a paper, an essay, a poem, a score, a song, a script, a film, a TV show, a game, a sculpture, a painting, a theatre production, a play, an opera, a musical, an exhibition, a legal case report, etc). This can be a work that is being quoted or referenced in detail (i.e. a citation), or it can just be a work that is mentioned in passing. A person's name is not the title of a work — even if people call that person a piece of work — and the element must therefore not be used to mark up people's names. (In some cases, the b element might be appropriate for names; e.g. in a gossip article where the names of famous people are keywords rendered with a different style to draw attention to them. In other cases, if an element is really needed, the span element can be used.) 	\\nMy favourite book is <cite>Introducing HTML5</cite> by Bruce and Remy\\n			
code		http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-code-element	The code element represents a fragment of computer code. This could be an XML element name, a filename, a computer program, or any other string that a computer would recognize. 	\\nTo get started with HTML5 you just need at this top of your page <code><!DOCTYPE html></code>\\n			
col		http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-col-element	If a col element has a parent and that is a colgroup element that itself has a parent that is a table element, then the col element represents one or more columns in the column group represented by that colgroup. 	\\n<table>\\n\\n\\t\\t<colgroup>\\n\\t\\t\\t<col class="column1" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<col class="column2" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<col class="column3-4" span="2" />\\n\\t\\t</colgroup>\\n\\t\\t<tr>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t<th>dog</th>\\n\\t\\t\\t<th>cat</th>\\n\\t\\t\\t<th>horse</th>\\n\\t\\t\\t<th>iguana</th>\\n\\n\\t\\t</tr>\\n\\t\\t<tr>\\n\\t\\t\\t<td>5</td>\\n\\t\\t\\t<td>2</td>\\n\\t\\t\\t<td>10</td>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t<td>500</td>\\n\\t\\t</tr>\\n\\t\\t...\\n</table>\\n			
colgroup		http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-colgroup-element	The colgroup element represents a group of one or more columns in the table that is its parent, if it has a parent and that is a table element. If the colgroup element contains no col elements, then the element may have a span content attribute specified, whose value must be a valid non-negative integer greater than zero. 	\\n<table>\\n\\t   <colgroup>\\n\\t\\t\\t<col class="column1" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<col class="column2" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<col class="column3-4" span="2" />\\n\\n\\t   </colgroup>\\n\\t\\t<tr>\\n\\t\\t\\t<th>dog</th>\\n\\t\\t\\t<th>cat</th>\\n\\t\\t\\t<th>horse</th>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t<th>iguana</th>\\n\\t\\t</tr>\\n\\t\\t<tr>\\n\\t\\t\\t<td>5</td>\\n\\t\\t\\t<td>2</td>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t<td>10</td>\\n\\t\\t\\t<td>500</td>\\n\\t\\t</tr>\\n\\t\\t...\\n</table>\\n			
command		http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-command	The command element represents a command that the user can invoke. A command can be part of a context menu or toolbar, using the menu element, or can be put anywhere else in the page, to define a keyboard shortcut. 	\\n<menu type="toolbar"><command type="radio" radiogroup="alignment" checked="checked" label="Left" icon="left.png" onclick="setAlign('left')" />\\n</menu>\\n			
datalist		http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-datalist-element	The datalist element represents a set of option elements that represent predefined options for other controls. The contents of the element represents fallback content for legacy user agents, intermixed with option elements that represent the predefined options. In the rendering, the datalist element represents nothing and it, along with its children, should be hidden. The datalist element is hooked up to an input element using the list attribute on the input element. 	\\n<label>Your favourite fruit:\\n<input type="text" name="fruit" list="fruits">\\n  <datalist id="fruits">\\n\\t<option value="Blackberry">Blackberry</option>\\n\\t<option value="Blackcurrant">Blackcurrant</option>\\n\\n\\t<option value="Blueberry">Blueberry</option>\\n\\t<!-- … -->\\n  </datalist>\\n</label>\\n			
dd		http://html5doctor.com/the-dl-element/	The dd element represents the description, definition, or value, part of a term-description group in a description list (dl element). 	\\n<dl>\\n<dt>address</dt>\\n<dd>The address element represents the contact information for the section it applies to. If it applies to the body element, then it instead applies to the document as a whole.\\n</dd>\\n<dt>article</dt>\\n\\n<dd>The article element represents a section of a page that consists of a composition that forms an independent part of a document, page, or site. This could be a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, a Web log entry, a user-submitted comment, or any other independent item of content.</dd>\\n</dl>\\n			
del		http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-del-element	The del element represents a removal from the document. Thedel elements should not cross implied paragraph boundaries 	\\n<p>My favourite colour is <del datetime="2010-10-11T01:25-07:00">blue</del> <ins datetime="2010-10-11T01:25-07:01">red</ins>, but I also like green and yellow.</p>\\n			
details		http://html5doctor.com/the-details-and-summary-elements/	The details element represents a disclosure widget from which the user can obtain additional information or controls. However, the details element is not appropriate for footnotes. 	\\n<details>\\n\\t<summary>Name & Extension:</summary>\\n\\n\\t<p><input type=text name=fn value="Pillar Magazine.pdf">\\n\\t<p><label><input type=checkbox name=ext checked> Hide extension</label>\\n</details>\\n\\t\\t\\n			
dfn		http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-dfn-element	The dfn element represents the defining instance of a term. The paragraph, description list group, or section that is the nearest ancestor of the dfn element must also contain the definition(s) for the term given by the dfn element. 	\\n<p>While they're essential reading material for our job, the <dfn><abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr></dfn> specifications are not exactly George R. R. Martin-level reading material.</p>\\n			
div		http://html5doctor.com/you-can-still-use-div/	The div element has no special meaning at all. It represents its children. It can be used with the class, lang, and title attributes to mark up semantics common to a group of consecutive elements. 	\\n<div>\\n\\t<p>content</p>\\n</div>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\n			
dl		http://html5doctor.com/the-dl-element/	Represents a description list consisting of zero or more name-value groups. Each group must consist of one or more names (dt elements) each followed by one or more values (dd elements). Name-value groups may be terms and definitions, metadata topics and values, or any other groups of name-value data. The values within a group are alternatives; multiple paragraphs forming part of the same value must all be given within the same dd element. 	\\n<dl>\\n\\t<dt>address</dt>\\n\\n\\t<dd>The address element represents the contact information for the section it applies to. If it applies to the body element, then it instead applies to the document as a whole.</dd>\\n\\t<dt>article</dt>\\n\\t<dd>The article element represents a section of a page that consists of a composition that forms an independent part of a document, page, or site. This could be a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, a Web log entry, a user-submitted comment, or any other independent item of content.</dd>\\n</dl>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\n			
dt		http://html5doctor.com/the-dl-element/	The dt element represents the term, or name, part of a term-description group in a description list (dl element). 	\\n<dl>\\n<dt>address</dt>\\n<dd>The address element represents the contact information for the section it applies to.

This could be a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, a Web log entry, a user-submitted comment, or any other independent item of content.</dd>\\n </dl>\\n			
doctype		http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-doctype	A DOCTYPE is a required preamble and must consist of the following characters, in this order: 	\\n<!DOCTYPE html>\\n<html lang="en">\\n<head>\\n<meta charset="utf-8" />\\n<title>HTML5 Doctor | Element Index</title>\\n<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />\\n\\n</head>\\n<body id="home">\\n<p>content</p>\\n</body>\\n</html>\\n\\t\\t\\n			
em		http://html5doctor.com/i-b-em-strong-element/	Represents stress emphasis of its contents. The level of emphasis that a particular piece of content has is given by its number of ancestor em elements. The 'stress' being referred to is linguistic. If spoken, this stress would be emphasised pronunciation on a word that can change the nuance of a sentence. 	\\nCall a doctor <em>now</em>\\n			
embed		http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-embed-element	Represents an integration point for an external(typically non-HTML) application or interactive content. The optional src attribute specifies the URL of the resource being embedded. The optional type attribute specifies the MIME type of the plugin to instantiate. The value must be a valid MIME type, optionally with parameters. If both the type attribute and the src attribute are present, then the type attribute must specify the same MIME type as the explicit Content-Type metadata of the resource given by the src attribute. 	\\n<embed src="movieclip.mov">\\n			
fieldset		http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-fieldset-element	The fieldset element is expected to establish a new block formatting context. If the fieldset element has a child that matches the conditions in the list below, then the first such child is the fieldset element's rendered legend: 	\\n<form id="app-login" action="process.php">\\n<fieldset>\\n<legend>Login Details</legend>\\n<div>\\n  <label for="user-name">Username:</label>\\n\\n  <input name="user-name" type="email" placeholder="Your username is your email address" required autofocus>\\n</div>\\n<div>\\n  <label for="password">Password:</label>\\n  <input name="password" type="password" placeholder="6 digits, a combination of numbers and letters" required>\\n</div>\\n<div>\\n  <input name="login" type="submit" value="Login">\\n</div>\\n</fieldset>\\n</form>\\n			
figcaption		http://html5doctor.com/the-figure-figcaption-elements/	The figcaption element represents a caption or legend for the rest of the contents of the figcaption element's parent figure element, if any. 	\\n<figure>\\n\\n\\t<img ... > (or video, table etc)\\n\\t<figcaption>A rabid unicorn goring a fairy.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n			
figure		http://html5doctor.com/the-figure-figcaption-elements/	The figure element represents some flow content, optionally with a caption, that is self-contained and is typically referenced as a single unit from the main flow of the document. The figure element can be used to annotate illustrations, diagrams, photos, code listings, etc., that are referenced in the main content of the document, but that could, without affecting the flow of the document, be moved away from that primary content — e.g., to the side of the page, to dedicated pages, or to an appendix. 	\\n<figure>\\n\\t<img ... > (or video, table etc)\\n\\t<figcaption>A rabid unicorn goring a fairy.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\t\\t\\n			
footer		http://html5doctor.com/the-footer-element-update/	Represents the "footer" of a document or section of a document.

form		http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-form-element	The form element represents a collection of form-associated elements, some of which can represent editable values that can be submitted to a server for processing. 	\\n<form id="app-login" action="process.php">\\n<fieldset>\\n<legend>Login Details</legend>\\n<div>\\n  <label for="user-name">Username:</label>\\n\\n  <input name="user-name" type="email" placeholder="Your username is your email address" required autofocus>\\n</div>\\n<div>\\n\\n  <label for="password">Password:</label>\\n  <input name="password" type="password" placeholder="6 digits, a combination of numbers and letters" required>\\n</div>\\n<div>\\n  <input name="login" type="submit" value="Login">\\n</div>\\n</fieldset>\\n</form>\\n			
h1-h6		http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-h1-h2-h3-h4-h5-and-h6-elements	Represent headings and subheadings. These elements rank in importance according to the number in their name. The h1 element is said to have the highest rank, the h6 element has the lowest rank, and two elements with the same name have equal rank. 	\\n<h(n)>Heading Title</h(n)>\\n			
head		http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-head-element-0	The head element represents a collection of metadata for the Document. 	\\n<!DOCTYPE html>\\n<html lang="en">\\n<head>\\n<meta charset="utf-8" />\\n<title>HTML5 Doctor | Element Index</title>\\n\\n<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="media/css/style.css" />\\n</head>\\n<body id="home">\\n<p>\\ncontent\\n</p>\\n</body>\\n</html>\\n\\t\\t\\n			
header		http://html5doctor.com/the-header-element/	Represents the "header" of a document or section of a document. The header element is typically used to group a set of h1–h6 elements to mark up a page's title with its subtitle or tagline. header elements may, however, contain more than just the section's headings and subheadings — e.g., version history information or publication date. 	\\n<header>\\n\\t<h1>HTML5Doctor.com</h1>\\n</header>\\n			
hgroup		http://html5doctor.com/the-hgroup-element/	Represents the heading of a section. The hgroup element is used to group a set of h1–h6 elements when the heading has multiple levels, such as subheadings, alternative titles, or taglines. 	\\n<hgroup>\\n\\t<h1>HTML5Doctor.com</h1>\\n\\t<h2>helping you implement HTML5 today</h2>\\n\\n</hgroup>\\n			
hr		http://html5doctor.com/small-hr-element/	Represents a paragraph-level thematic break. The "paragraph-level" bit means between blocks of text, so it can't be used to separate sections of a site. Instead, hr now separates different topics within a section of prose, or between scenes in a novel. 	\\n<p>Lorem Ipsum dolor set amet</p>\\n<hr />\\n<p>Lorem Ipsum dolor set amet</p>\\n			
html		http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-html-element-0	The html element represents the root of an HTML document. 	\\n<!DOCTYPE html>\\n<html lang="en">\\n<head>\\n<meta charset="utf-8" />\\n<title>HTML5 Doctor | Element Index</title>\\n\\n<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="media/css/style.css" />\\n</head>\\n<body id="home">\\n<p>\\ncontent\\n</p>\\n</body>\\n</html>\\n\\t\\t\\n			
i		http://html5doctor.com/i-b-em-strong-element/	Represents a span of text in an alternate voice or mood, or otherwise offset from the normal prose, such as a taxonomic designation, a technical term, an idiomatic phrase from another language, a thought, a ship name, or some other prose whose typical typographic presentation is italicized. Only use i when nothing more suitable is available — e.g., em for text with stress emphasis, strong for text with semantic importance, cite for titles in a citation or bibliography, dfn for defining a word, and var for mathematical variables. 	\\nThe term <i>prose content</i> is defined above.\\n<i class="taxonomy">Nanotyrannus</i> ("dwarf tyrant") is a genus of tyrannosaurid dinosaur, and is possibly a juvenile specimen of <i class="taxonomy">Tyrannosaurus</i>.\\n\\nWe ate <i lang="ja-latn" title="eel">unagi</i>, <i lang="ja-latn" title="seared salmon">aburi-zake</i>, and <i lang="ja-latn" title="octopus">tako</i> sushi last night.\\n			
iframe		http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-iframe-element	The iframe element represents a nested browsing context. For iframe elements in HTML documents, the attribute, if present, must have a value using the HTML syntax that consists of the following syntactic components, in the given order: 	\\n<iframe height="500" width="500" src="http://google.com"></iframe>\\n			
img		http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-img-element	An img element represents an image. The image given by the src attribute is the embedded content, and the value of the alt attribute is the img element's fallback content. The src attribute must be present, and must contain a valid non-empty URL potentially surrounded by spaces referencing a non-interactive, optionally animated, image resource that is neither paged nor scripted. The img element must not be used as a layout tool. In particular, img elements should not be used to display transparent images, as they rarely convey meaning and rarely add anything useful to the document. 	\\n<img src="logo.gif" alt="HTML5 Doctor Logo" />\\n			
input		http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-input-element	The input element represents a typed data field, usually with a form control to allow the user to edit the data. 	\\n<form id="app-login" action="process.php">\\n<fieldset>\\n<legend>Login Details</legend>\\n<div>\\n  <label for="user-name">Username:</label>\\n  <input name="user-name" type="email" placeholder="Your username is your email address" required autofocus>\\n\\n</div>\\n<div>\\n  <label for="password">Password:</label>\\n  <input name="password" type="password" placeholder="6 digits, a combination of numbers and letters" required>\\n</div>\\n<div>\\n  <input name="login" type="submit" value="Login">\\n</div>\\n</fieldset>\\n</form>\\n			
ins		http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-ins-element	The ins element represents an addition to the document. The ins elements should not cross implied paragraph boundaries. 	\\n<p>My favourite colour is <del datetime="2010-10-11T01:25-07:00">blue</del> <ins datetime="2010-10-11T01:25-07:01">red</ins>, but I also like green and yellow.</p>\\n			
kbd		http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-kbd-element	The kbd element represents user input (typically keyboard input, although it may also be used to represent other input, such as voice commands). When the kbd element is nested inside a samp element, it represents the input as it was echoed by the system. When the kbd element contains a samp element, it represents input based on system output, for example invoking a menu item. When the kbd element is nested inside another kbd element, it represents an actual key or other single unit of input as appropriate for the input mechanism. 	\\n<p>Mac users: To take a screenshot press <kbd><kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>3</kbd></kbd></p>\\n			
keygen		http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-keygen-element	The keygen element represents a key pair generator control. When the control's form is submitted, the private key is stored in the local keystore, and the public key is packaged and sent to the server. 	\\n<form action="/submit_key.php" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">\\n <keygen name="key">\\n <input type="submit" value="Submit">\\n</form>\\n			
label		http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-label-element	The label represents a caption in a user interface. The caption can be associated with a specific form control, known as the label element's labeled control, either using for attribute, or by putting the form control inside the label element itself. 	\\n<form id="app-login" action="process.php">\\n<fieldset>\\n<legend>Login Details</legend>\\n<div>\\n  <label for="un">Username:</label>\\n\\n  <input name="user-name" id="un" type="email" placeholder="Your username is your email address" required autofocus>\\n</div>\\n<div>\\n  <label for="pass">Password:</label>\\n  <input name="password" id="pass" type="password" placeholder="6 digits, a combination of numbers and letters" required>\\n</div>\\n<div>\\n  <input name="login" type="submit" value="Login">\\n</div>\\n</fieldset>\\n</form>\\n			
legend		http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-legend-element	The legend element represents a caption for the rest of the contents of the legend element's parent fieldset element, if any. 	\\n<form id="app-login" action="process.php">\\n\\n<fieldset>\\n<legend>Login Details</legend>\\n<div>\\n  <label for="user-name">Username:</label>\\n  <input name="user-name" type="email" placeholder="Your username is your email address" required autofocus>\\n</div>\\n\\n<div>\\n  <label for="password">Password:</label>\\n  <input name="password" type="password" placeholder="6 digits, a combination of numbers and letters" required>\\n</div>\\n<div>\\n  <input name="login" type="submit" value="Login">\\n</div>\\n</fieldset>\\n</form>\\n			
li		http://html5doctor.com/ol-element-attributes/	The li element represents a list item. If its parent element is an ol, ul, or menu element, then the element is an item of the parent element's list, as defined for those elements. Otherwise, the list item has no defined list-related relationship to any other li element. 	\\n <ol>\\n\\n\\t<li>Ordered List Item One</li>\\n\\t<li>Ordered List Item Two</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\t\\t\\n			
link		http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-link-element	The link element allows authors to link their document to other resources. The destination of the link(s) is given by the href attribute, which must be present and must contain a valid non-empty URL potentially surrounded by spaces. If the href attribute is absent, then the element does not define a link. A link element must have rel attribute. 	\\n<!DOCTYPE html>\\n<html lang="en_UK">\\n<head>\\n\\t<meta charset="UTF-8">\\n\\t<title>My Super Page</title>\\n\\n\\t<meta name="robots" content="index,follow" />\\n\\t<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">\\n</head>\\n			
map		http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-map-element	The map element, in conjunction with any area element descendants, defines an image map. The element represents its children. 	\\n<section>\\n\\n <h1>Clothing</h1>\\n <img src="/images/menu.gif" alt="Select a department to go to its page." usemap="#nav">\\n</section>\\n ...\\n<footer>\\n <map name="nav">\\n\\n  <p><a href="/women/">Women</a>\\n   <area alt="Women" coords="0,0,100,50" href="/women/"> |\\n   <a href="/men/">Men</a>\\n   <area ALT="Men" coords="0,0,100,50" href="/men/"> |\\n   <A HREF="/kids/">Kids</A>\\n\\n   <area alt="Food" coords="0,0,100,50" href="/kids/"> |\\n   </p>\\n </map>\\n</footer>\\n			
mark		http://html5doctor.com/draw-attention-with-mark/	Represents a run of text in one document marked or highlighted because of its relevance in another context. When used in a quotation or other block of text referenced in a document, it indicates a highlight that was not present in the original document — e.g., a portion of text in an academic publication that has recently come under additional scrutiny. 	\\nIn this sentence we'll be using the mark element. <mark>HTML5</mark> Can you see where it has been used?\\n			
menu		http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#menus	The menu element represents a list of commands. If a menu element's type attribute is in the context menu state, then the element represents the commands of a context menu, and the user can only interact with the commands if that context menu is activated. If a menu element's type attribute is in the toolbar state, then the element represents a list of active commands that the user can immediately interact with. If a menu element's type attribute is in the list state, then the element either represents an unordered list of items (each represented by an li element), each of which represents a command that the user can perform or activate, or, if the element has no li element children, flow content describing available commands. 	\\n<menu type="toolbar">\\n\\n\\t<command type="command" disabled label="Save" icon="icons/save.png" onclick="save()">\\n\\t<command type="command" disabled label="Publish" icon="icons/pub.png" onclick="publish()">\\n</menu>\\n			
meta		http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#meta	The meta element represents various kinds of metadata that cannot be expressed using the title, base, link, style, and script elements. The meta element can represent document-level metadata with the name attribute, pragma directives with the http-equiv attribute, and the file's character encoding declaration when an HTML document is serialized to string form (e.g. for transmission over the network or for disk storage) with the charset attribute. 	\\n<!DOCTYPE html>\\n\\n<html lang="en_UK">\\n<head>\\n\\t<meta charset="UTF-8">\\n\\t<title>My Super Page</title>\\n\\t<meta name="robots" content="index,follow" />\\n\\t<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">\\n\\n</head>\\n			
meter		http://html5doctor.com/measure-up-with-the-meter-tag/	When the meter binding applies to a meter element, the element is expected to render as an 'inline-block' box with a 'height' of '1em' and a 'width' of '5em', a 'vertical-align' of '-0.2em', and with its contents depicting a gauge. When the element is wider than it is tall(or square), the depiction is expected to be of a horizontal gauge, with the minimum value on the right if the 'direction' property on this element has a computed value of 'rtl', and on the left otherwise. When the element is taller than it is wide, it is expected to depict a vertical gauge, with the minimum value on the bottom. 	\\nYour score is: <meter> 2 out of 10 </meter>\\n			
nav		http://html5doctor.com/nav-element/	Represents navigation for a document. The nav element is a section containing links to other documents or to parts within the current document. Not all groups of links on a page need to be in a nav element — only groups of primary navigation links. In particular, it is common for footers to have a list of links to various key parts of a site, but the footer element is more appropriate in such cases. 	\\n<nav>\\n\\t<ul>\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Nav Link</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Nav Link</li>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t<li>Nav Link</li>\\n\\t<ul>\\n</nav>\\n			
noscript		http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-noscript-element	The noscript element represents nothing if scripting is enabled, and represents its children if scripting is disabled. It is used to present different markup to user agents that support scripting and those that don't support scripting, by affecting how the document is parsed. 	\\n<noscript>Oh no, you either have JavaScript turned off or your browser doesn't support JavaScript</noscript><noscript><link rel="stylesheet" href="no-js.css" /></noscript>\\n			
object		http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-object-element	The object element can represent an external resource, which, depending on the type of the resource, will either be treated as an image, as a nested browsing context, or as an external resource to be processed by a plugin. 	\\n<object>\\n\\t<param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/XZ5TajZYW6Y?fs=1&amp;hl=en_GB"></param>\\n\\n\\t<param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param>\\n\\t<param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param>\\n\\t<embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/XZ5TajZYW6Y?fs=1&amp;hl=en_GB" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="390"></embed>\\n\\n</object>\\n			
ol		http://html5doctor.com/ol-element-attributes/	The ol element represents a list of items, where the items have been intentionally ordered, such that changing the order would change the meaning of the list. 	\\n<ol>\\n\\t<li>Ordered List Item One</li>\\n\\n\\t<li>Ordered List Item One</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\t\\t\\n			
optgroup		http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-optgroup-element	The optgroup element represents a group of option elements with a common label. The element's group of option elements consists of the option elements that are children of the optgroup element. When showing option elements in select elements, user agents should show the option elements of such groups as being related to each other and separate from other option elements. 	\\n<label for="country">Country</label>\\n\\n<select name="country" id="country">\\n<optgroup label="Europe">\\n\\t<option value="UK">UK</option>\\n\\t<option value="Germany">Germany</option>\\n\\t<option value="France">France</option>\\n\\n</optgroup>\\n<optgroup label="North America">\\n\\t<option value="">USA</option>\\n\\t<option value="">Canada</option>\\n</optgroup>\\n</select>\\n			
option		http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-option-element	The option element represents an option in a select element or as part of a list of suggestions in a datalist element. In certain circumstances described in the definition of the select element, an option element can be a select element's placeholder label option. A placeholder label option does not represent an actual option, but instead represents a label for the select control. 	\\n<label for="country">Country</label>\\n<select name="country" id="country">\\n<optgroup label="Europe">\\n  <option value="UK">UK</option>\\n\\n  <option value="Germany">Germany</option>\\n  <option value="France">France</option>\\n</optgroup>\\n<optgroup label="North America">\\n  <option value="">USA</option>\\n\\n  <option value="">Canada</option>\\n</optgroup>\\n</select>\\n			
output		http://html5doctor.com/the-output-element/	Represents the result of a calculation. The optional for attribute allows an explicit relationship to be made between the result of a calculation and the elements representing the values that influenced the calculation. If specified, the for attribute must contain a string consisting of an unordered set of unique, space-separated tokens, each of which must be the ID of an element in the same document. 	\\n<form>\\n<label for="flying">Flying Skill Level</label>\\n<input name="flying-level" id="flying" type="range" min="0" max="250">\\n<output for="flying" onforminput="value = flying.valueAsNumber">0</output>\\n</form>\\n

param		http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-param-element	The param element defines parameters for plugins invoked by object elements. It does not represent anything on its own. 	\\n<object>\\n\\t<param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/XZ5TajZYW6Y?fs=1&amp;hl=en_GB"></param>\\n\\t<param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param>\\n\\n\\t<param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param>\\n\\t<embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/XZ5TajZYW6Y?fs=1&amp;hl=en_GB" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="390"></embed>\\n\\n</object>\\n			
pre		http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-pre-element	The pre element represents a block of preformatted text, in which structure is represented by typographic conventions rather than by elements. 	\\n<p>The code for a basic JavaScript message is:</p><pre><script>alert("hello world");</script>\\n\\n</pre>\\n			
progress		http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-progress-element	Represents the completion progress of a task. Progress may be either indeterminate — meaning it is unclear how much work remains before the task is complete (e.g., the task is waiting for a response from a remote host) — or a numeric value between 0 and a given maximum, explicitly specifying the fraction of work that has so far been completed. 	\\n<section>\\n <p>Progress: <progress> <span id="p">0</span>% </progress> </p>\\n\\n <script>\\n  var progressBar = document.getElementById('p');\\n  function updateProgress(newValue) {\\n\\tprogressBar.textContent = newValue;\\n  }\\n</script>\\n</section>\\n

rp		http://html5doctor.com/ruby-rt-rp-element/	Represents a container for parentheses used to wrap ruby text (<rt>) inside a <ruby> element. These are displayed by browsers which don't support <ruby>, allowing for graceful degradation of ruby content. Browsers which support <ruby> hide <rp> via display:none. 	\\n<ruby>??<rp>(</rp><rt>????</rt><rp>)</rp>???<rp>(</rp><rt>?????</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>\\n			
rt		http://html5doctor.com/ruby-rt-rp-element/	Represents a container for ruby text inside a <ruby> element. <rt> content becomes the small annotations rendered by default above horizontal base text or to the right of vertical base text. 	\\n<ruby>??<rp>(</rp><rt>????</rt><rp>)</rp>???<rp>(</rp><rt>?????</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>\\n

small		http://html5doctor.com/small-hr-element/	Represents side comments such as small print. It is not intended to be presentational. The small element should not be used for extended spans of text such as multiple paragraphs, lists, or sections of text. It is only intended for short runs of text. 	\\n<footer>\\n\\t<address>\\n\\tFor more details, contact\\n\\t<a href="mailto:hello@html5doctor.com">HTML5 Doctor</a>.\\n\\t</address>\\n\\t<small> © copyright HTML5 Doctor. </small>\\n\\n</footer>\\n

The document's title is often different from its first heading, since the first heading does not have to stand alone when taken out of context. 	\\n<!DOCTYPE html>\\n<html lang="en_UK">\\n<head>\\n\\t<meta charset="UTF-8">\\n\\t<title>My Super Page</title>\\n\\t<meta name="robots" content="index,follow" />\\n\\t<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">\\n\\n</head>\\n			
tr		http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-tr-element	The tr element represents a row of cells in a table. 	\\n<table>\\n<tr>\\n\\t<th scope="col">dog</th>\\n\\n\\t<th scope="col">cat</th>\\n\\t<th scope="col">horse</th>\\n\\t<th scope="col">iguana</th>\\n</tr>\\n\\n<tr>\\n\\t<td>5</td>\\n\\t<td>2</td>\\n\\t<td>10</td>\\n\\n\\t<td>500</td>\\n</tr>\\n...\\n</table>\\n			
track		http://html5doctor.com/video-subtitling-and-webvtt/	The track element allows authors to specify explicit external timed text tracks for media elements. It does not represent anything on its own. 	\\n<video src="movie.webm">\\n\\n\\t<track src="subtitles.vtt" kind="subtitles" srclang="en" label="English">\\n</video>\\n			
u		http://html5doctor.com/u-element	The u element represents a span of text with an unarticulated, though explicitly rendered, non-textual annotation (when you are annotating something, but not explicitly saying what it is). Examples include indicating misspelt words, labeling proper names in traditional Chinese prose, or indicating a family name when the name’s order is non-western. 	\\n<span itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person" lang="ja-latn">\\n  <u itemprop="familyName">Son</u> <span itemprop="givenName">Goku</span>\\n</span>\\n\\n			
ul		http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-ul-element	The ul element represents a list of items, where the order of the items is not important — that is, where changing the order would not materially change the meaning of the list. 	\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li>Unordered List Item One</li>\\n\\t<li>Unordered List Item One</li>\\n\\n</ul>\\n\\t\\t\\n			
var		http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-var-element	The var element represents a variable. This could be an actual variable in a mathematical expression or programming context, or it could just be a term used as a placeholder in prose. 	\\n<p><var>E</var> energy is equal to <var>m</var> mass multiplied by the <var>c</var> speed of light, squared.</p>\\n			
video		http://html5doctor.com/the-video-element/	Represents a video or movie. Content may be nested inside the video element. User agents should not show this content to the user. Authors should use this content to force older browsers to use a legacy video plugin or to inform the user of how to access the video content. 	\\n<video src="video.ogv" controls poster="poster.jpg" width="320" height="240">\\n<a href="video.ogv">Download song</a>\\n</video>\\n			
wbr		http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-wbr-element	The wbr element represents a line break opportunity. Any content inside wbr elements must not be considered part of the surrounding text. 	\\nhtml5<wbr>doctor.com\\n
