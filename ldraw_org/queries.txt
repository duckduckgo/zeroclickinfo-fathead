# Here's a query for LDraw part number 4600.
# The expected result looks something like this:
#
#     4600 (Unofficial LDraw Part)
#     Plate  2 x  2 with Wheel Holder (parts/4600.dat - 1 subfile isn't certified. (CCSF))
#     More at LDraw Parts Tracker
#
# The title line (& "More at...") is linked to detail page at
# http://ldraw.org/cgi-bin/ptdetail.cgi?f=parts/4600.dat
# The part number in the snippet is linked directly to the file at
# http://www.ldraw.org/library/unofficial/parts/4600.dat
# Preview images are constant scale, so size varies among parts.

ldraw 4600

#
# A complementary function is to support part number lookup by name,
# as illustrated by the query below. The result should be 4600, as above.
#
# However, I'm not sure how to implement support for this - is a second
# table, with name as the first field (title), required? Or, could both
# name and number be included in the title field, without interfering
# with queries that specify only one or the other?
