### What am I doing?
You will write a script that scrapes or downloads the data source below, and generates an **output.txt** file containing the parsed documentation. You can learn more about Fatheads and the `output.txt` syntax [**here**](https://docs.duckduckhack.com/resources/fathead-overview.html).


**Data source**: {URL to Data Source}
<!-- ^^^ FILL THIS IN ^^^ -->

**Instant Answer Page**: *to be created by developer*
<!-- ^^^ FILL THIS IN, AFTER ISSUE IS CLAIMED ^^^ -->

### What is the Goal?
As part of our [Programming Mission](https://forum.duckduckhack.com/t/duckduckhack-programming-mission-overview/53), we're aiming to reach 100% Instant Answer (IA) coverage for searches related to programming languages by creating new Instant Answers, and improving existing ones.

Here are some Fathead examples:

- Ruby Docs
    - [Code](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-fathead/tree/master/lib/fathead/ruby) | [Example Query](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=array+bsearch&ia=about)
- MDN CSS
    - [Code](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-fathead/tree/master/lib/fathead/mdn_css) | [Example Query](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=css+background-position&ia=about)
