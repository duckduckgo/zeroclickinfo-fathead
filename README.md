Early attempts at writing "[fathead](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-fathead/blob/master/README.md)" search modules for DuckDuckGo.

- `ldraw_org` would search the [LDraw Parts Tracker](http://ldraw.org/library/tracker/) for information about unofficial parts.
- `tcl_ref` would search the [reference manual for Tcl/Tk 8.5](http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.5/).
